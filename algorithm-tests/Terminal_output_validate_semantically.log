But such grace doesn’t come easily. In line with the kind of radical politics pushed around their hometown of San Francisco, Grass Widow proudly self-identify as a leaderless band with a democratic songwriting process. When that type of consensus decision-making works, it’s beautiful. But consensus is never an easy process: individuals often end up making compromises to accommodate the shared values of the group as a whole. With her solo project <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/31310-ruby-pins/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby Pins</a>, Grass Widow drummer/singer Lillian Maring has stepped away from those limitations to spend time inside her own head and embrace her darker creative impulses. The result, written over three years and self-recorded with a laptop and one microphone, is a haunting collection of cryptic pop songs.</p> <p>Maring’s autonomous vision shines through its abstractions; through its way of shaping spooked moods with heavy, cyclical drumbeats, shadowy surf riffs, and enigmatic wordless vocal hooks. Like in Grass Widow, the vocals on <i>Ruby Pins</i> are consistently low in the mix, veiled by home-recording hiss, making space for Maring’s psychedelic guitars and spiraling keys to sing the stories just as much as her voice does. Sometimes, Maring self-harmonizes for double-tracked parts, deadpanning like a girl-gang of one (“Gagging on the Obvious”) while at other points she sings woozy pop melodies (“Lost Art”). The words are rarely audible, but it always sounds like she’s trying to tell us something.</p> <p>The album starts with the dim and distant chugging riffs of “Chariot”, an opener that sounds like a moving vehicle racing away. “My Friends Are Insane” could be a sketch pulled from Maring’s diary; her words are urgently plainspoken over echoes of murky instrumentals. “Girl Store” is similarly arcane and downcast, a collage of what sounds like recorded conversations pieced together. A recurring high-pitched voice sounds like a little girl lost in a toy store: “ha ha ha,” she hums over shuffling circus-like percussion. “Begotten” contains barely any lyrics, but is one of the most entrancing tracks on side B; a nightmarish four-minute jam that starts out with a mess of indecipherable words drowned out by a meandering minor-chord guitar line and speeding percussion. It'd make a good soundtrack for a haunted fun house.</p> <p>In a recent <a href=\"http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/grass-widows-chameleon/Content?oid=3577183\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">interview with<i> East Bay Express</i></a> surrounding the release of <i>Ruby Pins</i>, Maring slowly unveiled some of the heavy baggage she was dragging around while writing lines like, “No day is the right day to die/ No day is the right day to die” on \"Chameleon\". In 2010, she lost her boyfriend to cancer, and writing <i>Ruby Pins</i> was one way of grieving. While it's hard to forget such a tragic story, it’s also not entirely necessary to know in order to sense the surreal, ever-present gloom of <i>Ruby Pins</i>. In fact, the obscured lyrics (the record doesn’t come with a lyric sheet) almost prevent Maring's personal life from driving the narrative of her debut. It further proves, though, that the most intrinsically human records are ones an artist makes entirely for herself.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n"], ["title", "Ruby Pins: Ruby Pins"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18239-ruby-pins-ruby-pins/"]]

It's become hard to pin them down them at this point. They don't appear to have many peers, or even particularly care about anything going on around them. It's easy to imagine them locked away in their Ocropolis studio in Brooklyn, falling ever further into the cycles of repetition that gather around them like an impenetrable force whenever they play. <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28796-people-of-the-north/\">People of the North</a> is a side project from Oneida's Kid Millions and Bobby Matador, a duo now onto their third album together, and their first for <a href=\"http://thrilljockey.com/splash.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thrill Jockey</a>. <i>Sub Contra</i> picks up where they left off on last year’s <i>Steep Formations</i>, even bringing in the same guests, Shahin Motia and Barry London. It's a short set of instrumental jams with a purposeful looseness in the playing, often underpinned by a sense of gloom that loosely ties it to the last couple of Oneida records.</p> <p>The Ocropolis appears key in the making of this album and much of Millions and Matador's other works. Unshackled from the burden of recording against the clock and with no need to keep an eye on per-hour rates, it feels like they dug far deeper into the music. It's difficult to picture <i>Sub Contra</i> coming out the way it has if they hadn't unlocked those freedoms. That liberation has brought them to a curious spot here, one that's somewhere between fully formed ideas and first-thought improvisation. Millions is one of the tightest drummers in the business when he wants to be, but on People of the North records he prefers a more scattershot approach, sometimes appearing completely absorbed in his own world. For the twin \"Sub Contra 1\" and \"Sub Contra 2\" he skews into jazzy fills, lightly playing around the exhaust-fume drones that char away at the center of the suite.</p> <p>What's most interesting about <i>Sub Contra</i> is the interplay between the two players and the guests they bring in. Sometimes it's tight, focused, locked into the same vision. At other times they wander off on individual tangents, only to slowly drag each other back to the same point. \"Coal Baron\" is easily the highlight of the former work, with its glassy ambient textures mirroring the more reflective work of krautrock bands such as <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/\">Tangerine Dream</a>, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5820-popol-vuh/\">Popol Vuh</a>, and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/\">Cluster</a>. Krautrock has long been a touchstone for Oneida, but mostly the driving, fiercely hypnotic side of the genre. \"Coal Baron\" is People of the North getting in touch with gentler patterns, subtly tracing out its rhythms through tiny organ figures and trance-y loops. In contrast, the closing 14-minute \"Osage Orange\" demonstrates their wayward side, with Millions coming perilously close to performing a drum solo before nailing it down into a harmonious place at its close.</p> <p>The shifts in style from <i>Sub Contra</i> further enforce the sense of near limitless flexibility and detachment that surrounds the guys in Oneida. Sometimes this feels like a glimpse into their studio process, resembling a 40-minute snippet of tape cut from a few lengthy workouts that no doubt stretched long into the night. But there's a passion here that gives it more value than that, a feeling that this is something they're compelled to do regardless of how accepting the outside world is to it. <i>Sub Contra</i> is a limited edition of just 500 vinyl copies, something for devoted followers to chew on during the (likely very brief) time before these guys embark on something else. But there's no air of exclusivity here. In fact, it's quite the opposite. People of the North is a project that’s all about openness, about laying processes bare, about welcoming people in to what would otherwise be a very private moment.</p>\n"], ["title", "People of the North: Sub Contra"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18203-people-of-the-north-sub-contra/"]]

Even as an early adopter of the once-trendy witch house’s echoing hysterics, Dexter’s music always sounded best when love was involved and there was someone there to help drive that stake through his heart. His earlier solo work was easily lumped in with the subgenre he refused to associate with, but with the help of vocalists (and compelling vocal samples), oOoOO has always sounded like something bigger than a fad.</p> <p>With his debut full-length, Dexter’s ear for dramatics is stronger than ever. He hasn’t strayed from the dimly lit brooding that took over <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14674-ooooo-ep/\"><i>oOoOO</i></a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16462-ooooo-our-love-is-hurting-us-ep/\"><i>Our Love Is Hurting Us</i></a>, but in the years since his style has moved out of the spotlight, the musician has figured out what he wants to do with it: go pop. He’s mentioned a local train outside of his apartment window as inspiration while working on the album, saying that the clattering on the tracks stopped him from dozing off. That dynamic is key here: Much of this album is a haze that sucks you in only to push back out when the listener comes too close to being enveloped in its cloudiness.</p> <p>Where Dexter's catalog has a tendency to quicksand around drone-like samples, the production on <i>Without Your Love</i> is more focused than it’s ever been. On “Misunderstood”, one of <i>Without Your Love</i>’s strongest tracks, the bass is enunciated as a wind of muted synths sprawl in the background; once you start wondering whether or not the climatic waves of chopped vocals crooning “Maybe you misunderstood” is a Brandy snippet from “Boy Is Mine”, you’ll be doomed to listen to the song on repeat. But it’s here where Dexter's R&amp;B flair comes through; when his vocal manipulations are as strong as his production technique. “Stay Here” harkens back to <i>Our Love Is Hurting Us</i>’ “Break Yr Heartt”, and “Without Your Love” is practically cheery.</p> <p>There’s no way to avoid the gloom though, and with it, the witchy, goth tropes to which oOoOO has invited assocation. With the album being released on Dexter’s own Night Feelings, he’s undoubtedly trying to break out of that mold. But the dark, gut-flipping menace pulls through despite the cleaner production. “Crossed Wires” is a staticky call from some sort of haunted monastery, warped chanting and all. “Mouchette” floats airy croons and waves of synths over a fantastic hammering of industrial reverb. “The South” takes another route, blending stuttering beats and flying wails into a trap instrumental that could easily host a rapper or two.</p> <p>It’s unclear if oOoOO has larger pop aspirations, or if he’s making tracks with vocalists to play with the idea of straight R&amp;B or rap production. If nothing else, songs like “Across the Sea”, with its sauntering groove, melodic keys, and pitched-down vocals do feel like an ambitious go at indie-pop songwriting. Still, the ideas on <i>Without Your Love</i> are a little too disparate to indicate what he’s getting at. The sequencing helps, making a story out of songs that would otherwise feel uncomfortably out of sorts. But while, overall, this is the strongest collection we’ve seen from oOoOO, it’s still difficult to tell what direction he’s trying to lead us in. <i>Without Your Love</i> ends up becoming a loose survey of Dexter's work instead the Nihjgt Feelings statement he intended it to be.</p>\n"], ["title", "oOoOO: Without Your Love"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18217-ooooo-without-your-love/"]]

Deep into his fifties, he hasn’t lost a beat or slowed down a bit, but instead churns out album after album after EP after one-off solo thing after album. Already in 2013 he has released a new <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/\">Guided by Voices</a> album, a full-length under his Teenage Guitar pseudonym, a singles box set, and a 12”, with who knows what all else planned for the next six months. It’s been this way for decades now, such that Pollard’s chief trait as an artist is the frequency of his output. Consequently, it’s all too easy to forget that he’s not just a prolific songwriter, but a good songwriter, too. Indie rock’s own Joyce Carol Oates possesses an insanely deep vocabulary of classic-rock tropes, a facility with killer hooks, and an idiosyncratic lyrical style that has matured to reveal new depths of wisdom, humor, and harrumphing crotchetiness.</p> <p>It should surprise exactly no-one that <i>Honey Locust Honky Tonk</i> is a good record: Even at his most unedited and undigested, Pollard’s music still displays a joy in its own resourcefulness, a contentment in its own faith in the power of rock and roll to define a life. In other words, every release is worth spinning at least once. But it should surprise everyone that <i>Honey Locust Honky Tonk</i> is a <i>very</i> good record, his best and most focused in quite some time. One byproduct of his prolific nature is a constant flattening out of his catalog, so that everything, especially at this end of his career, begins to blur together; the highs never seem quite so exciting anymore, the lows no longer quite so embarrassing, and very little stands out as essential. That any particular release stands out at all is by now a small miracle.</p> <p>Pollard’s dedication to the form has always been impressive, and he has remained largely untouched-- or unperturbed, or uncompelled-- by outside forces or trends in rock and roll. Instead, he has burrowed deeper and deeper into his beloved classic rock and has somehow managed to find new modes of expression in this tiny realm of music. “Circus Green Machine” builds on great bursts of acoustic guitar power chords that sound like Pete Townshend is about spin a yarn, while “Strange and Pretty Day”, the album’s lowest-fi recording, nods to Skip Spence or maybe <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1356-roky-erickson/\">Roky Erickson </a>with its insistent one-note piano theme. By this point, Pollard has even become his own reference point: Scuff up the sound a bit and “Airs” or “Igloo Hearts” wouldn’t be out of place on <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3600-bee-thousand-the-directors-cut/\"><i>Bee Thousand </i></a>or <i>Alien Lanes.</i></p> <p>Even if it’s not hard to imagine a 30-something Pollard penning these new tunes, <i>Honey Locust Honky Tonk</i> nevertheless sounds like the work of a man with some years and experience behind him. There’s some polish on the melodies, a new forthrightness in the lyrics. And by forthright, I mean how he repeats the pretzel-logic line, “We may never not know,” ad infinitum on “It Disappears in the Least Likely Hands (We May Never Not Know)” and still makes it sound somehow poignant. There’s always been an odd melancholy to Pollard’s music, but there’s a peculiar gravity to the psych-rockin’ “Her Eyes Play Tricks on the Camera” and the country-rockin’ “I Killed a Man Who Looks Like You”. A desperate gregariousness pervades the 44-second toast “I Have to Drink” and surely informs the camp-choir sing-along that ends “Real Fun Is No One’s Monopoly”.</p> <p>The guitars on <i>Honey Locust Honky Tonk</i> can be sluggish at times, especially during the more cumbersome anthems, and the tracklist could stand some pruning. But these are perennial complaints, excusable for being bound up among his many eccentricities, and Pollard compensates with what seems like a greater sense of mission. Mortality looms over <i>Honey Locust Honky Tonk, </i>explicitly defining songs like “Who Buries the Undertaker” while implicitly informing fragments like “Shielding Whatever Needs You”. Rather than dour, however, the album sounds concerned, perhaps even worried, which illuminates even some of its weaker or seemingly extraneous tracks. It focuses Pollard, who sounds like a man who has said so much already but still has so much left to say.</p>\n"], ["title", "Robert Pollard: Honey Locust Honky Tonk"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18249-robert-pollard-honey-locust-honky-tonk/"]]

AraabMuzik's mutation of that dynamic into a steady, prolonged all-peaks churn is the key: who says you have to <i>wait</i> for the drop? In that sense, <i>The Remixes Vol. 1 </i>isn't significantly different than his previous records' approaches. There's more of a feel of “official” business to it; much of the source material comes from the Ultra Music label and skews closer to the Electric Daisy Carnival aesthetic than anything AraabMuzik's worked with to date. But that's the closest there is to a unifying background to <i>The Remixes</i>, which really does make his own choppily momentous, joyously abrasive, and widely sourced sense of rhythm the biggest common denominator.</p> <p>Mt. Eden's “Sierra Leone” is a sort of mission statement. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16bRiH5zfOY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">In its original form</a>, it's as steadily composed and fluid as wobbly bass anthems get, a balanced split between hard bombast and billowy emotion that might sound like a maximalist <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/\" target=\"_blank\">Clams Casino</a> if you stripped out all the wubs. Which is just what AraabMuzik does at the outset, juicing it up with orchestra hits and rearranging the beat so it's more distinctly hip-hop-friendly. And once the wobble-bass <i>does </i>get dropped in, it's more of a rumbling shudder than the hyperactive hiccups in the original. Further elements of AraabMuzik's style show up in more transformative moments, like the nearly from-scratch rebuild of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6p5W30BV1U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolfgang Gartner's Omarion-featuring “Still My Baby”</a>. That cut revamps its tweaky electro house chords into a more spread-out melody that stalks like a 1980s slasher-flick villain over a more traditional house 4/4, then unexpectedly disintegrates into a puddle of rattling snares that make a point of proving why the best trap comes from a miles-deep hip-hop grounding.</p> <p>Not that <i>The Remixes Vol. 1 </i>pins him to any genre constraints. Style trumps niche every time here, and in its efficiently compact sub-hour runtime there's plenty of opportunity to let that style run through all kind of territory. His take on <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/\" target=\"_blank\">Skrillex</a>'s omnipresent remix of Benny Benassi's “Cinema” cuts to the chase, as AraabMuzik lets that hyperventilating gatling-laser drop loop for long enough to make its overamped malfunctioning slot-machine spasm feel as simple and immediate as the “Ante Up” horns. <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5636-steve-aoki/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Aoki</a>'s <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/8562-kid-cudi/\" target=\"_blank\">Kid Cudi</a>/Travis Barker collab “Cudi the Kid” is saved from its flabby trance-n-bass excess with a slick minor-key pitch shift and a regrouping around a martial, mid-tempo slice of breakbeat. It's ambitious recontextualization, even if it gets away from him a little: another Gartner cut, “Cognitive Dissonance”, lives up to the title with some abrupt borderline-trainwreck swings from electro to boom-bap that would work together as individual pieces. And his soulful remix of Taana Gardner's 81 b-boy disco staple “Heartbeat” sticks out amidst all this top-dollar superclub material like a banana-seat Schwinn Sting-Ray at the Tour de France, though it's no big dealbreaker when the worst thing you can say about a mix selection is that it makes you wish he'd do an old-school all-West End Records set.</p> <p>But the real thread here, characteristically enough, is mood. AraabMuzik's always had a tendency to twist even the most euphoric hands-up moments of EDM crowdpleasers into something more overcast and ambivalent, and that's what continues to keep his material compelling. It's easy to hear the excitement and flashiness in his beats, but there's just enough restraint and lingering darkness that it's like siphoning all the gloss off candy paint or replacing neon with flourescent lights. Turning big drops into hypnotic loops, ditching crescendos for churn, programming and manipulating beats that shudder restlessly in otherwise Swiss-timing rhythmic constraints-- this isn't simple edit work, it's an entire tonal shift. That said, there are two original cuts here. One is closer “Keep it in Motion”, a showcase for NoLa rapper Chase N. Cashe that, while a pretty straightforward money-flinging door-kicker with the MC on it, shows up earlier as an instrumental that reveals some tense, icy arpeggios driving those chattering snares. The other one's a sparse number featuring bleary, slowly floating chords and near-subliminal mournful choir vocals. The title? “Darkside”. Just so you know where he's coming from.</p>\n"], ["title", "AraabMuzik: The Remixes, Vol. 1"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18267-araabmuzik-the-remixes-vol-1/"]]

It's hard to tell, sometimes, if those noises represent the crackle of cell phone interference or the creaky floor of an old house: The opening piece, \"Neighborhood\", churns together little bits of composer and performer Aaron Roche's processed voice with furious scribbles of tremolo'd string, a waveform that Wohl snags with his software and distends, so that we no longer picture human arms generating the sound. There are an abundance of other noises here, too, all of them of hazy origin-- some percussive clicks, some radiant, soft-edged keyboard arpeggios, a shimmer effect that resembles locusts or a lawn sprinkler. There is some groaning, burping electronic noise in the music's low end that could be a groaning double bass or electronics. This zone of confusion, between the digital glitch and bow-on-string screech, is where Wohl lives, and <i>Corps Exquis </i>gets more interesting the more confused you get.</p> <p>The album, recorded by the modern classical guitarist and composer Andrew McKenna Lee, is beautiful and maze-like, with sounds emanating from all directions in your listening space. It is performed by the excellent five-piece ensemble Transit (percussion, clarinet and bass clarinet, violin, cello, and piano), which Wohl co-founded. The album is a kind of all-star affair, at least as far as the tight-knit world of NYC contemporary classical is concerned: So Percussion show up on \"Neighborhood\"; <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/\" target=\"_blank\">Julia Holter</a> drops by on \"Corpus\". They render Wohl's music as a world overrun with small scrapes and fidgets, constantly scurrying across the floorboards while larger, more patient sounds operate above. \"Insext\" opens on a digital storm of white noise, overlaid with wisps of bowed string harmonics. A little string melody eventually rises out of the din, like someone whispering some half-remembered Copland, but it's promptly buffeted by waves of digital percussion. This push and pull, this sense that the music Transit plays is being sucked into the void and spit out transformed, like the tennis-ball scene in <i>Poltergeist</i>, is part of what makes Wohl such an original voice.</p> <p>His voice is not manic, however, and his canvas is not seething: Even as it's surrounded by a clattering of pots and pans, the center of \"323\" is a radiant, booming nimbus of major chords, moving slowly. \"Cantus\" meanwhile, opens on a gently piling snowdrift of strings, all bowing in different pattern to create a gorgeously featureless expanse similar to Arvo Pärt's <i>Fratres For Eight Cellos</i>. Slowly, other noises creep into the frame-- a sharp, stabbing cello sound, some hollow rattles, like bottles being racked up at a bar counter. The piece dissolves, near the end, into a distressed racket of competing cries from all players, but Wohl leaves us with a contemplatively cool sound in its last seconds, a small sigh. In each piece, clamor briefly overwhelms serenity, but each time, clamor loses.  </p> <p>Most pieces operate on both planes at once: \"Ouverture\" generates a hushed, expectant mood that recalls George Crumb's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoE0ffvhlDE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Star-Child\"</a>. That piece builds its most fearsome roar from an old-fashioned pedaled piano, then fans out into a soothing hum of manipulated string textures. Whatever Wohl's vision is, about the noise of digital lives, and how they affect the mind, it isn't binary: Solace, these pieces seem to argue, can come from anywhere we look for it. </p>\n"], ["title", "Daniel Wohl: Corps Exquis"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18244-daniel-wohl-corps-exquis/"]]

Even the \"electronic\" tag doesn't entirely fit at times-- core members Andi Toma and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/31340-jan-st-werner/\">Jan St. Werner</a>'s respective backgrounds are as a guitarist and a drummer, and their live shows often feature the charismatic Dodo NKishi behind the trap set. St. Werner has made solo recordings under various guises before, but here he steps out under his own name for the first time, again blurring perceptions and stretching at definitions of his working method. This is the inaugural release in the Fiepblatter series for <a href=\"http://thrilljockey.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thrill Jockey</a>, which will focus on field recordings, improvisational works, and other elements drawn from the margins of sound.</p> <p><i>Blaze Colour Burn</i> is a suitably amorphous statement of intent for this proposed set of releases, principally because it's a series of fractured recordings that are as much about what's happening around the sounds as the sounds themselves. The two-part \"Spiazzacorale\" has been edited down from an eight-hour live performance in Italy, and is frequently punctured by audience movement, a low-lying conversational murmur, and other crowd noise. At one point it appears to collapse altogether, only for St. Werner to bring it back in a burst of brilliant color via the sound of a traditional Umbrian band. It's far from the studied work of Mouse on Mars, replacing that band's strictures with a looseness that feels freeing. The non-live material works that way too-- \"Sipian Organ\" acts like an industrialized take on <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/\">Brian Eno</a>'s ambient works, oscillating between quiet background drones and sharp, metallic foreground noise.</p> <p>The amount of space in the recording is key, sometimes causing it to resemble a performance happening far off in the distance, at other times situating everything front and center. It makes listening to <i>Blaze Colour Burn</i> a distinctly physical experience. In quieter moments you might strain to hear what's going on; similarly, when the extraneous crowd bustle is foregrounded, it feels like your brain needs to do some filtering to get to what's important. As such, it also poses questions about what the important elements are when listening to music, especially when non-musical forms take on a strange rhythm of their own. There are no echelons of significance here-- an audience member coughing adds just as much as the ripples of vibraphone that light up \"Spiazzacorale\", mainly because of the sense of place they bring.</p> <p>It's surprising how much movement there is in these ruptured, abstract pieces, with St. Werner casting each track as a tiny journey to undertake. Part of its <a href=\"http://thrilljockey.com/thrill/Jan-St-Werner/Blaze-Colour-Burn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">stated intent</a> is for the listener to question their position in relation to the music, to figure out where they are situated in the listening process. It works along those lines to a certain extent, but there's also a flipside to it that has more in common with St. Werner's work in Mouse on Mars, where you get slung adrift, wandering around in gigantic structures like the 13-minute \"Cloud Diachroma\". <i>Blaze Colour Burn</i> lands somewhere in between music that makes you hyper-aware of your place in relation to it and something that removes you from thinking about yourself altogether. That split creates a subtle tension at the heart of the record, positioning it as a maze-like structure where getting lost and found become equally gratifying.</p>\n"], ["title", "Jan St. Werner: Blaze Colour Burn"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18112-jan-st-werner-blaze-colour-burn/"]]

Maybe it’s because along with the first few waves of Chicago house it formed the basis for the entire form, and because it’s never been overexposed via car ads or rock musicians briefly reinventing themselves as “electronica” artists. But there’s also something simply aesthetically perfect about the style: minimalist and dark and, when it’s executed well, really hard to imagine as improvable in any way. It’s like the sonic equivalent of the black band t-shirt.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/851-carl-craig/\">Carl Craig</a> has come closer than any other artist to locating the style’s aesthetic ideal, the sweet spot between <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/\">Kraftwerk</a>’s organically icy machine music and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1505-funkadelic/\">Funkadelic</a>’s deeply human funk exploration that remain its two most essential influences. His entry in the Ministry of Sound’s Masterpiece series of mixes by ground-laying dance music pioneers is not only a great trilogy of three CD-length sets, but something like a self-portrait or an autobiography in sound, and an intriguing look into the mind of a master musician.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Disc one, titled “Aspiration”, is meant to be a 70-minute sample of what he’s up to these days as a DJ. It leads off with “Zug Island”, a 2012 single by Detroit natives Kyle Hall &amp; Kero, and named after a blighted, heavily industrialized man-made island in the most polluted part of the city. In true Detroit minimalist fashion it consists of little more than a pattern of noisy drums, an ambiently beeping bell-tone synthesizer, and another synth repeating a three-note bassline. It’s a ridiculously simple arrangement, but fascinating to hear as the sounds begin to evolve, with delays dropping in and out and the bassline mutating from a gentle throb to an acid-house freakout. The sounds are modern, but it’s also a perfect representation of the aesthetic philosophy on which techno was founded.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>For the remainder of “Aspiration”, Craig shifts seamlessly back and forth between stark minimalism and more lushly elaborate (by comparison) sounds. Many of the contributions come from newer artists working in the Detroit style, but there are also excursions into house-ier stuff, and a brief glimpse at one of Craig’s influences through the inclusion of Egyptian Lover’s 1984 world-shaker “Egypt Egypt”.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The second mix, “Inspiration”, is a more thorough exploration of the music Craig’s been affected by. Some it’s the kind of stuff you might expect him to cite: fellow techno artists of the old school like Derrick May, e-Dancer, and Moritz von Oswald. Other inclusions are more eye-opening. There’s experimental reggae from African Head Charge and digital dancehall originator King Jammy. There’s R&amp;B from DeBarge and Erykah Badu. There’s a track from <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15999-david-lynch-crazy-clown-time/\">David Lynch</a>’s 2011 album <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15999-david-lynch-crazy-clown-time/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Crazy Clown Time</i></a>, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5547-freeway/\" target=\"_blank\">Freeway</a>’s “All My Life,” and a bossa nova-influenced track from Melody Gardot. Muddy Waters’ “Mannish Boy”, the Temptations’ psychedelic-era “Cloud Nine”, and the organ-heavy proto-hard rock cut “In the Jungle” by the Motown-signed group the Messengers represent a fuzzed-out, loose-limbed approach to making music that’s difficult to see reflected in Craig’s own work.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>If “Aspiration” and “Inspiration” are Craig surveying his present and past, the final disc finds him looking forward, staking out new stylistic territory and proving that after almost 25 years of recording he’s still evolving as an artist. “Meditation” is a suite of six new, original compositions for modular synthesizer that explore a much different side to Carl Craig than we’re used to seeing. As the title indicates, they’re the result of directing his talents for bare-bones arrangement and selecting fascinatingly dark sonic palettes to ends that are far more suited to contemplation than dancing.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The sounds of his modular synthesizer setup invite comparisons to synth wizards of the past like Vangelis, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/\" target=\"_blank\">Tangerine Dream</a>, and John Carpenter, but the way he uses it is bracingly original and often daring. The individual tracks, most of them coming in around the 10-minute mark, drift between downtempo but danceable songs that hint at techno and Italo disco on one hand, and on the other pure, trance-inducing ambience. The former kind are rewarding, and offer the unique sort of pleasure that comes from hearing an accomplished artist working with a different set of tools to normal, but the ambient stuff is even more fascinating.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It makes sense that one of the modern masters of minimalist composition would be able to apply his talents successfully to a style that’s historically compatible with bare-bones arrangements, and the end results exceed expectations. They’re richly textured despite their sonic sparsity, and full of the energy that separates ambient music that engages the listener’s mind from the kind that just puts them to sleep. It’s so engaging, in fact, that at one point Craig pulls down everything in the mix until there’s only a deep, throbbing bass tone that you can only hear on headphones or a halfway decent set of speakers. </span>The really tricky part of it is that you might very well find yourself pulled so far into it that you don’t even notice the missing instruments until they come back in minutes later. It’s a master-level maneuver that underlines the essential theme of the three-disc set, which is that after a quarter century of pushing music into the future, Carl Craig’s still not done.</p>\n"], ["title", "Carl Craig: Masterpiece"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18097-carl-craig-masterpiece/"]]

This recording of a headline show by <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/\">New Order</a> at 2012's <a href=\"http://www.bestival.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bestival</a> on the Isle of Wight offers plenty of moments that don't necessarily sit well-- Bernard Sumner bellowing \"come on!\" in the middle of a stadium-ized version of \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\", the inclusion of non-classic era songs \"Krafty\" and \"Here to Stay\", the absence of Peter Hook on bass. But if you trace their history it's clear that the stoic image they partly cultivated has gradually loosened and fallen away as the years have passed, sometimes becoming distinctly at odds with the impeccable Peter Saville sleeves and Factory marketing acumen of yore. This is, after all, a group that chose to perform on the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2RFmKmkEr4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baywatch set</a> when invited to play \"Regret\" on Top of the Pops in 1993.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">What's remarkable about New Order circa 2013 is the amount of good will that continues to flow toward them despite their obvious flaws. Hook is gone, Sumner has often seemed disinterested in the band, it's arguably been 20 years since they penned anything like a good song, and this is their third go-around following a 2011 reunion with an altered lineup. Yet, listen to the version of \"Blue Monday\" here and you can hear the (no doubt huge) crowd faithfully singing along at times, turning it into an unlikely festival anthem. They sound comfortable in this space, and so they should. Their notable festival appearances are legion at this time, arguably beginning with a headline slot at the 1989 Reading Festival, which played a big part in transforming that event from a parade of has-beens into something approaching vitality (Starship of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydOB-YNJ8Jw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\"</a> fame topped the bill the previous year).</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The question of whether Hook is missed is somewhat moot. His basslines are played impeccably by Tom Chapman, for the most part. But Hook's presence was always a key part of their makeup, a flash of dirt and menace to counteract Sumner’s boyish exterior. It's possible that Hook’s leather trouser act no longer befits someone of his years, but still it's probably better that this is being released as an audio document as opposed to a visual one. We're also spared the sight of Sumner's erratic performance, with his voice sometimes comically strained (horribly so in \"True Faith\") or sounding like he's out of breath (\"Bizarre Love Triangle\"). But New Order were rarely ever a slick machine live, and mostly </span><i>Live at Bestival</i><span> highlights the shortcomings of documenting them in such a light; what once might have been drunk, celebratory fun sounds distinctly less so in the cold, sober light of day.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">This is a charity album, released to aid the <a href=\"http://www.iowyouthtrust.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Isle of Wight Youth Trust</a>, and as such it's a commendable venture. Still, its placing in the New Order discography is hardly likely to be significant, especially as the <i>Live at the London Troxy </i>album from 2011 already documented this incarnation of the group in a live setting (and with a similar tracklisting). There's a certain joy to be found in them tearing through \"Regret\"-- a song that always seemed designed for such cavernous surroundings-- or hearing them stretch out a 10-minute-plus version of \"Temptation\". It's when they turn to smaller moments that things backfire, such as the decidedly unsure steps taken through the opening \"Elegia\", reduced here to a runtime of less than three minutes, which feels especially puny following the release of the 17-and-a-half minute version on the <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5766-retro-box-set/\"><i>Retro</i></a> box set.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><i>Live at Bestival</i> won't tear anyone away from the riveting <i>Taras Shevchenko</i> live video from 1981, but it's still hard not to crack a smile at how corny Bernard Sumner can be on occasion. His between-song banter is the sound of someone utterly comfortable with what his group have become, a veteran festival headline act happy to work through the hits. It's about as far away as you can get from the multiple shades of black that cloaked the original <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/\">Joy Division</a> songs liberally sprinkled throughout the setlist, but there's a strong sense of vindication in the robust vigor of \"Transmission\", a feeling that this music was always destined to connect to an audience far beyond those who first claimed it. Sumner's almost certainly having far too much fun to care either way. \"Cheers, thank you Bestival,\" he says at the close of the set. \"What a great festival. It's the best... festival.\"</p>\n"], ["title", "New Order: Live at Bestival 2012"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18246-new-order-live-at-bestival-2012/"]]

On “Picasso Baby”, Jay boasts “House like the Louvre or the Tate Modern/ Because I be goin’ ape at the auction.” I doubt he meant it to be <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZAR4z8uyq0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">“Poppin’ Tags”</a> for the Sotheby’s set-- a vulgar display of net worth that puts him in the tax bracket of shipping magnates and NBA owners-- but it comes across as a context and appraisal-free recitation of famous names, a Winner’s History of Modern Art.</p> <p>The same can be said of the collaborators. Like <i><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17736-justin-timberlake-the-2020-experience/\">The 20/20 Experience</a>, </i>the latest album from his <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/49659-jay-z-and-justin-timberlake-detail-their-summer-stadium-tour-legends-of-the-summer/\">Legends of the Summer</a> tourmate <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4920-justin-timberlake/\">Justin Timberlake</a>, <i>Magna </i>is a hedge-betting, black-tie/Black Card affair that’s not just an account of luxury, but an accessory to it. Marquee names <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland\">Timbaland</a>, Swizz Beatz, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell\">Pharrell</a>, Timberlake, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/\">Beyoncé</a>, and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3002-nas\">Nas</a> all lend their talents-- and <i>all </i>appear on “BBC”. The money isn't totally wasted, as these are some of the stranger beats Jay’s rapped over in some time. Witness the contorted, metallic pings of “Tom Ford”, “Somewhereinamerica”’s drunken ragtime horns, or the codeine-laced, dubby “Crown”. Jay is at least trying to interact with a hip-hop mainstream that has evolved a great deal since his last true solo album, though <span>relegating the production of reigning MVP Mike Will Made It to a one-minute interlude (\"Beach Is Better\") smacks of unintended elitism. </span></p> <p>At its best, <i>Magna</i> is a record that only a 43-year-old Jay-Z could make. “Heaven” is the most thought-provoking spiritual meditation he’s written, and the willful misreading of “Losing My Religion” is used to powerful effect. “Jay-Z Blue” ruminates on the responsibilities and cyclical pathologies of fatherhood with warmth and self-doubt rather than the bitterness that marked what had previously been his most family-minded LP, <i>The Dynasty: Roc La Familia. </i>But Jay also manifests a worst case scenario for “dad-rap.” Twelve albums in, he’s still Muhammad Ali, he’s Michael Jackson, he’s Michael Jordan, he’s Frank Sinatra-- the latter is the most deflating comparison, if only because Jay-Z is using him as a prop for yet another lyric about how he did it “my way.” As tedious as these hoary references can be, it's worse when <i>Magna Carta </i>dabbles in contemporary name-drops and Jay-Z becomes Jay Leno-- mentions of <i>Homeland, </i>Instagram, Scott Boras, and Miley Cyrus’ <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrUvu1mlWco\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">twerkin’ incident</a> bomb like failed monologue jokes between idle chatter.</p> <p>Unlike <i>Watch the Throne, </i>Jay-Z lacks a foil to bring out an emotional or sociological underpinning, someone to help <i>Magna Carta</i> resonate beyond <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2013/03/james-franco-spring-breakers-speech.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">“look at my shit.”</a> Timberlake is in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MbwMu139nc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">“my name is Bob and I work at my job”</a> mode during the laughably overblown <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/51413-listen-jay-z-holy-grail-ft-justin-timberlake\">“Holy Grail\"</a>, cycling through every tortured artist cliché short of a crucifixion metaphor. And as bad as the “Smells Like Teen Spirit” interpolation reads on paper, once you hear JT and Jay-Z duet on “and we all just entertainers/ And we’re stupid and contagious,” the Nirvana song becomes just another forgettable status symbol. And where Kurt Cobain felt compromised by his fame, Jay and Timberlake are doing everything in their power not to offend the money people-- whether it’s Samsung, Target, or someone dropping $250 to see them at the Rose Bowl. </p> <p>Jay-Z rapping about the incomprehensible awesomeness of his life is nothing new, and the corporate synergy is hardly a novelty: <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4219-the-black-album/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>The Black Album </i></a>doubled as a retirement party, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9647-kingdom-come/\"><i>Kingdom Come </i></a>was launched by a Budweiser commercial, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10879-american-gangster/\"><i>American Gangster </i></a>coincided with a Hollywood blockbuster of the same name, and, in hindsight, <i>Blueprint 3 </i>was made with full knowledge that Jay-Z would be Coachella’s first hip-hop headliner. He’s a businessman <i>and </i>a business, man. After all, while Samsung shelled out seven figures for exclusive access to the Jay-Z brand, Shawn Carter was the guy signing the contract and cashing the check. But the best of those joint ventures seemed determined to reach a new audience and create a connection. The weirdly distant and safe <i>Magna Carta Holy Grail </i>abides by the tried and true business principle that the customer is always right: you just have to remember who the customer is here. </p>\n"], ["title", "Jay-Z: Magna Carta Holy Grail"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18247-jay-z-magna-carta-holy-grail/"]]

She appeared last spring in a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFR8yVn8GSo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">handful</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXP1oFmRboI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">of</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFR8yVn8GSo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">videos</a> that embodied drill’s most enticing qualities: youthful DIY energy, a cohesive aesthetic, and simple, brutally menacing hooks. Her one-off tracks and her first mixtape, <a href=\"http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/18708/katie_got_bandz_bandz_and_hittaz.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Bandz and Hittaz</i></a>, were spun around infectiously loud chants delivered in a raspy bark, underscoring Waka Flocka Flame’s role as the godfather of drill. She’s also become something of a rap-lover’s folk-hero, largely because she’s a master of slang and catch phrases-- <i>\"Katieeeee!\"</i>-- and because her online persona is brashly funny. “ROMENY SAID MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY IS IRRELEVANT FUCK HIM,” she wrote on Twitter during the Presidential Election as part of her ongoing personal campaign against Mitt Romney. \"THE BEST PART ABOUT NOT GIVING A FUCK IS REALLY NOT GIVING A FUCK,\" she once wrote. Her jubilant confidence has often been thrilling.</p> <p>But when Katie took the stage at this year's South by Southwest for her show at the Fader Fort-- which you could stream live online-- she froze up, timidly shouting over a backing track like someone who'd lost a bet at a crowded karaoke bar. Gone was the ebullient swagger and take-no-prisoners attitude that got her noticed over the last year. Her long-promised new mixtape, the delightfully titled <a href=\"http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/21187/katie-got-bandz-drillary-clinton.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Drillary Clinton</i></a>, transmits that trepidation and inexperience. What could’ve been an event tape is instead a minor release that will likely lurk in the shadows of Katie’s outsized persona.</p> <p>Higher stakes seem to have an adverse affect on Katie’s brute-force approach to rapping. Excepting “Y U Mad”-- a sneaky hit in its own right-- and the King Louie collaboration “Pop Out”, there’s a hesitant, unnatural air to <i>Drillary Clinton</i> that finds Katie dragging through some of her verses, sounding timid or lethargic rather than purposefully measured or unhurried. “Fuck fighting/ We shooting/ Catch up!/Y’all losing/ Keep it on us/ No snoozing!”, she shouts on the cumbersome “Finessin’” (like many of <i>Drillary Clinton</i>’s tracks, this one was produced by drill mainstay BlockOnDaTrakk). Occasionally the apprehension or clumsiness is endearing: the Auto-Tuned “Foreign” has an ugly-beautiful sound not unlike Chief Keef’s “Citgo”; her imitations of other rappers’ adlibs-- “skirrrr!”, “nawwhh”, “bow-bow”-- expose her as someone who just plain loves rap music.</p> <p>Still, she recedes from the foreground too often-- something that doesn’t work, given her style's emphasis of presence over lyrical dexterity. This becomes especially clear when she's heard alongside guests like Dreezy, who offers an explosive verse on “Knock a Hoe”. Dreezy's another young woman from the Chicago's drill scene-- paradoxically, the hyper-aggressive sound has tended to neutralize gender, breeding a disproportionately large crop of new female rappers. Inside it all, Katie sits quietly, reminding us that she still has plenty of room to grow into the authoritative spirit she baited us with at the onset.</p>\n"], ["title", "Katie Got Bandz: Drillary Clinton"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17934-katie-got-bandz-drillary-clinton/"]]

When they released <i>Sense Net </i>last year, Nash’s presence still loomed large, even amidst the influence of vintage avant-electronic acts and industrial bands. Since then, however, the pair have struck out on a far more idiosyncratic course. <i>Contact</i>, their first full-length, abandons <i>Sense Net</i>’s gently psychedelic R&amp;B bump, along with anything resembling traditional pop song structure. Maybe those things are still there somewhere, just radically mutated, rapidly evolved into unrecognizable new shapes.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><i>Contact</i><span> opens with a short sound effects vignette where someone enters a high tech enclosure and connects to a data network using a computer that offers roughly digital voice prompts. Having successfully logged in, we encounter reverb-rich pads, synthesized nonsense vocal sounds, and finger snaps that lead in a beat that skitters and booms and refuses to settle into one steady pattern. Instead, it flickers between drum &amp; bass, Chicago footwork, two-step, and, during a couple of moments, the kind of R&amp;B the pair were doing back on </span><i>Sense Net</i><span>.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The rest of the songs operate in a similar fashion, with the pair establishing a sonic premise, then giving it a gentle push and following where it rolls. “Narco” begins with metallic-toned synth arpeggios, a minimal but vaguely menacing kick drum part, and a sprinkling of aquatic-sounding digital blips. Over the next eight minutes, it touches on everything from turn of the millennium radio rap to VHS-era action movie soundtracks, and includes a frantic digital slap bass solo and tones that sound like they could have been sampled from a vintage PC operating system.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Many of the songs float off into full-on ambience at some point in their journey. “Arcadia” actually begins there, with long, leisurely stretches of blissed-out synth pads decorated with little scraps of sound-- a heavily manipulated vocal sample or a brief keyboard figure-- that float leisurely by. Every once in a while a little bit of structure creeps in and the song drifts almost to the point of something that could pass for R&amp;B, but only briefly, and then it drifts gently back.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It’s an intensely dreamy record, and a very futuristic one too. It’s a slightly dated brand of futurism though, full of sounds lifted from primitive early samplers, organic percussion sounds that suggest a particularly 90s “tribal” aesthetic, and low-resolution computer voices that say things like “data connection” and “systems online.” It’s the sound of 2013, but more specifically of 2013 as it looked in the early days of </span><i>Wired</i><span> magazine, when digital culture was first starting to emerge. </span><i>Contact</i><span> seems like the type of thing the fringier characters from a William Gibson cyberpunk novel would put on when they want to kick back and smoke a spliff.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">It’s kind of a bummer to see two producers who were so good at making a particular kind of music essentially leave it behind with barely any finished recordings to show for it (although they still dabble in R&amp;B with the Chicago vocal trio <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/31126-jody/\" target=\"_blank\">JODY</a>), but that’s really the only disappointing thing about <i>Contact</i>. It may not offer pre-existing the-Drum fans what they may have thought they wanted from the group’s first album, but what it delivers is powerful stuff. The pair only recently started performing outside of Chicago, and last week I saw them play one of their first shows in New York City. No one was dancing, which is usually a huge problem for a concert of what’s ostensibly dance music, but the two didn’t seem concerned in the least bit as they built up, warped, and tore down one richly textured sonic structure after another. And they shouldn’t have been. No one was dancing, but everyone was mesmerized.</p>\n"], ["title", "The-Drum: Contact"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18210-the-drum-contact/"]]

Migos are both natural descendents of Atlanta's florid coke rap cottage industry and purveyors of something defiantly stranger. On the surface, <i>Young Rich Niggas</i> appears to traffic in slight, hooky pop rap, but the abundance of aesthetic and lyrical quirks here also genuflect to rap’s frayed outskirts.</p> <p><i>Young Rich Niggas</i>’ lyric sheet is a vast expanse of trap house platitudes, but Quavo, Offset, and Takeoff’s absurdist humor sets these songs apart from the pack. “China Town” juggles plentiful references to Asian culture-- Honda, Mortal Kombat, Manny Pacquiao-- hilariously failing to hit on anything legitimitely Chinese. Mixtape highlight “Hannah Montana” is a flurry of bald-faced boasts about proficiency at dealing drugs, but the codenames for the product are all culled from white female TV, movie, and pop stars. It’s the song’s chorus that illuminates Migos’ incontrovertible weirdness, though. At the end of each verse Quavo bludgeons the mix shouting “Hannah Montana! Hannah Montana! Hannah Montana! Hannah Montana!” until he’s driven home the principal silliness of the word combo. Migos' choruses work like that a lot of the time: the badgering, hypnotic repetition of “Trapped out the bando” on “Bando” and the comically insistent “Versace/ Versace Versace/ Versace Versace” refrain of “Versace” warp each phrase in your mind until they hit the ear like something other than English, hammering hooks home with the manic urgency of toy commercials.</p> <p>If that seems like a shaky foundation for an hour-long mixtape, know that Migos’ bag of rhyme schemes is more varied and adventurous than simple catchphrase repetition: <i>Young Rich Niggas</i> houses capable double-time speed trials like “Cook It Up”, brawlers like “Hannah Montana” and “China Town”, the half-baked self-satisfied stunting of “Bando”, dalliances with sung hooks on “Adios” and Auto-Tune experimentation on “Finesser” and “Pronto”. And for all its smart alecky veneer, <i>Y.R.N.</i> is shot through with a palpable darkness that comes to a head at the end of the tape: there's the one-two punch of “R.I.P.”, an ode to Future’s recently deceased Freeband Gang associate OG Double D, and “Thank You God (Outro)”, a rags-to-riches yarn that charts Migos’ progression from childhood adversity (“Daddy was a hospital patient/ Next thing you know he ain’t make it”) to financial comfort that’s couched in the self-flagellating remorse of Offset’s proclamation that he “sinned every day just to get this success.”</p> <p>Migos’ deceptively simple lyricism favors production that follows suit. Trap’s booming 808s and ticking hi-hats are still present, but where the production of, say, a Rick Ross song is designed to blurt out of speakers like a battering ram pushed it through, <i>Y.R.N.</i> shoots for pared down productions that highlight the strengths of the songwriting. The staccato synth blips on Zaytoven’s “Versace” beat race against the lyrics laid over them. The plodding piano line on “Adios” walks in lock step with its sung hook. Dun Deal fades the foreboding bells and guitars of “Hannah Montana” after each verse, punching up Quavo’s frantic chorus for maximum effect. Guest MCs similarly fold into the songs where they’re featured. Gucci Mane goes along with the gummy Auto-Tune shtick of “Dennis Rodman”, and Trinidad James and Riff Raff’s contributions to “Out Da Gym” are surprisingly reserved. (<a href=\"pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/\" target=\"_blank\">Drake</a> jumped on a remix of “Versace” last week and coopted the Migos cadence with childlike zeal.)  The willingness of Migos’ collaborators to follow their lead feels like a vote of confidence in their sound, a rarity in a time of rap game Frankenstein’s monsters like A$AP Rocky’s “Fuckin’ Problems” and Kanye West’s remix of Chief Keef’s “Don’t Like”, releases that played like pic-stitches of the artists’ famous friends.</p> <p><i>Young Rich Niggas</i> finds Migos perfecting their sound even as they bristle at it, and the tape rarely delivers anything resembling a failure. The subject matter can be suffocating in its cavalier depravity, especially on tracks like “FEMA”, which employs a heavy-handed metaphor comparing one’s speed at whipping up crack to the movements of Hurricane Katrina, and Migos’ kingpin fantasies also hit a few sour notes racially speaking. (See: <i>Y.R.N.</i>’s bottomless stream of Latin names for cocaine connects and “China Town”, whose adventures in drug smuggling are periodically punctuated by gross “ching chong” ad libs.) <i>Y.R.N.</i>’s indiscretions are usually, mercifully scant, however, and the group never approaches this material with anything less than an affable, good-natured goofiness. With <i>Young Rich Niggas</i>, Migos have peeled the gruff exterior off of trap and revealed the giddy, catchy party music underfoot.</p>\n"], ["title", "Migos: Y.R.N.

It’s <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4456-townes-van-zandt/\" target=\"_blank\">Townes Van Zandt</a>’s most popular tune by a good mile, an enigmatic tale of two outlaws on the run from the <i>federales</i>-- like <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i> if Robert Redford had shot Paul Newman in the back. The most popular version is by <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3107-willie-nelson/\">Willie Nelson</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1872-merle-haggard/\">Merle Haggard</a>, which hit Number One on the country charts in 1983. <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2045-emmylou-harris/\">Emmylou Harris</a> covered it, as did <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1283-steve-earle/\">Steve Earle</a>, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5581-michael-hurley/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac\">Michael Hurley</a>, and countless amateurs on YouTube. Just this past Record Store Day, Elizabeth Cook released a tender version on a b-side with <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5343-jason-isbell/\">Jason Isbell</a>. It's taken that many people to even begin to figure out what exactly the song is about and how it works: Does it eulogize Pancho Villa, the notorious Mexican outlaw who reportedly had a friend named Lefty? If so, why does it not match up to the known details of his life? Is it an allegorical tale? A huckster’s hoax? A Mexican-American tall tale reduced to life-size proportions? Whatever it is, the song possesses a stark sadness as the lyrics recount not only the death of Pancho but also the last lonely days of Lefty. “Pancho needs your prayers, it’s true, but save a few for Lefty, too,” goes that last verse. “He just did what he had to do, and now he’s growing old.”</p> <p>Such powerful understatement was typical of Van Zandt, who preferred to insinuate emotions rather than state them outright. That approach put him (and other songwriters like him) at odds with the sentimentality of mainstream Nashville in the 1970s, when such artists as <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5219-dolly-parton/\">Dolly Parton</a>, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2586-loretta-lynn/\">Loretta Lynn</a>, and even the <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/696-johnny-cash/\">Man in Black Himself</a>, deep into his cornball phase, evoked the past in perfectly pastoral terms, as though rural poverty constituted paradise. Rootless and all but disowned by his oil-wealthy Texas family, Van Zandt was too much of a wanderer to indulge such nostalgia for simpler times. Instead, his songs address the present moment, whether implicitly or explicitly. That’s why so many people have read “Pancho &amp; Lefty” as conceptual rather than actual: It’s so unconcerned with evoking a point in time that it becomes somehow timeless-- not merely relevant across decades, which it certainly has proved to be, but more interested in ideas rather than actual men. That’s what is meant when Van Zandt is described as “cosmic.”</p> <p>There are two versions of “Pancho &amp; Lefty” among the three new Van Zandt reissues from Omnivore Records, who hopefully have many more in the wings. Not only could the pair not be any more different from one another and still be the same song, but each version speaks to a different aspect of Van Zandt’s appeal. The first, from his 1972 album <i>The Late Great Townes Van Zandt</i>, was produced by Cowboy Jack Clement, who fills the space in the song with strings, mariachi horns, and all manner of studio tricks. The second, an alternate mix on the 2xCD demos and alt-takes set <i>Sunshine Boy</i>, is minimal by comparison, with only a handful of live instruments accompanying Van Zandt. The only elements that connect them are his unpretentiously hangdog vocals and that wandering piano line that never finds a place to rest and so enacts the song’s outlaw existentialism.</p> <p>Here are two sides of Van Zandt, as clearly distinguished as if by state lines. The full studio version is decorous and even a bit gaudy, as was Cowboy Jack’s peculiar style, but it’s also moody and cinematic, with those horns evoking a wide-open plain that’s either a desert or a void. Historically, it’s been too easy to dismiss this version, as many Townes fans disregard Clement’s studio ministrations as overwrought and overbearing. Even Van Zandt himself disowned the horns and strings, claiming they were added without his say-so. And yet, on “Pancho &amp; Lefty” as throughout <i>The Late Great</i>, Clement’s production tends to be as eccentric as Van Zandt himself. The lackadaisical plod of his cover of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/8980-hank-williams/\">Hank Williams</a>’ “Honky Tonkin’” implies a Music Row absurdism bolstered by the pots-and-pans percussion and fuzzed-out guitar solo. The sci-fi experiment “Silver Ships of Andilar” is self-consciously grandiose, almost like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4810-serge-gainsbourg/\">Serge Gainsbourg</a> drinking Shiner and munching kolaches, and ominous synths interrupt the crushing desperation of “Snow Don’t Fall”, a devastating memorial to his girlfriend, who was murdered while hitchhiking to a recording session. If <i>The Late Great</i> is overwrought, as even Colin Escott claims in the new liners, it’s always overwrought with great purpose and conceptual weight.</p> <p>The alternate mix of “Pancho &amp; Lefty”, advertised on the tracklist as “without strings and horns,” points to another facet of Van Zandt’s catalog, which jibes more easily and naturally with listeners’ understanding of the Lone Star troubadour. It’s earthier and more direct-- a very real and gritty story rather than a parable-- as the Texan ponders the deep ache of severed friendship, abrupt betrayal, and lifelong regret. Because these demos and alt-takes emphasize austere arrangements that push Van Zandt’s vocals to the forefront, <i>Sunshine Boy</i> may be the ideal point of entry for listeners intimidated by his decades-spanning catalog as well as by his reputation as the ultimate songwriter’s songwriter. It includes many of his best songs, including what may be the best version of “To Live Is to Fly”. The guitar picking is clear and immediate, the vocals more fluid in their phrasings, accentuating the song’s casual melody. Van Zandt considered it among his best compositions, and it’s not hard to see why: In addition to conveying a simple philosophy of existence as a journey to some unknown destination, it evokes the transience of life lived out on the road, culminating in a few verses that are as close to perfect as Van Zandt-- or any other country musician, for that matter-- ever got: “It’s goodbye to all my friends, it’s time to go again,” he sings with affecting stoicism. “But think of all the poetry and the pickin’ down the line.”</p> <p>Sadly, it’s impossible to miss that the themes Van Zandt explored in his lyrics are themes that played out in his own life, which was defined by rootlessness, loneliness, senseless tragedy, and unending remorse. The songs on these three reissues-- which are so of a piece and of a moment that they may best be thought of as a single, very persuasive box set-- all share a sense of motion, of always passing people by: the life of a touring musician certainly, but also the days of a man unmoored in the American West. Van Zandt had brief careers in college and the Air Force, which were cut short by bouts of depression, alcoholism, and insulin shock therapy. Despite his reputation among his peers as an ace picker and songwriter, his recording career was a non-starter, interrupted by a 10-year absence during which he laid low and played roadhouses around Texas but rarely, if ever, entered a studio. The characters in these songs-- especially those who serve as stand-ins for Van Zandt himself-- are always on the verge of leaving wherever they are, although he manages to cut that melancholy with the optimism that their paths will cross again. “Well, goodbye friends, it’s time to close, everybody knows that’s the way it goes,” he sings on “You Are Not Needed Now”, which loses none of its evocative power for never being too specific about its subject. “Where was it you lived in case I’m ever there?”</p> <p>That song appears twice on <i>Sunshine Boy</i> and once on <i>High, Low &amp; In Between</i>, but the alternate take, which features a piano intro and a band that knows the absolute best time to come in, may actually be the definitive version of the song, with a hymnal directness and a stoicism in the face of endless farewells. If <i>The Late, Great</i> sharpens the cosmic cowboy orchestrations and <i>Sunshine Boy</i> winnows the songs to their barest essentials, then <i>High, Low and in Between</i> more than lives up to its title. Unsurprisingly, Van Zandt inhabits the in-between so comfortably that this becomes one of the best country-rock records ever made, full of humor (“No Deal”), heartache (“Greensboro Woman”), and commiseration  (“Highway Kind”). Softening that melancholy somewhat is a trio of country-gospel numbers that strike a celebratory note: “Two Hands” opens the album by explaining that his physical body makes possible spiritual salvation through music, while “Standin’” (a rearrangement of a traditional tune) suggests that his troubles extend well beyond his birth and death. In other words, his life is just an excerpt of a continuum of despair; the song itself is, cosmically, upbeat.</p>\n"], ["title", "Townes Van Zandt: High, Low and in Between / The Late, Great Townes Van Zandt / Sunshine Boy: The Unheard Studio Sessions and Demos 1971-1972"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18190-townes-van-zandt-high-low-and-in-between-the-late-great-townes-van-zandt-sunshine-boy-the-unheard-studio-sessions-and-demos-1971-1972/"]]

He's a space cadet in the interview, turning idly in a messy room. By my count he names eight items, three of which are stuffed animals, with a fourth being a shelf of children's action figures overlooking his computer. It's a performance by an artist who at the time was still trying to shake his reputation as a barely legal trance wunderkind/Britney Spears remixer: Holden had burst onto the scene in the late 90s with the kind of progressive tracks that fans <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf8d7Pz2Ssg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">still upload</a> to YouTube accompanied by pictures of beaches and sunsets.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">He probably wouldn't admit it, but Holden learned something from those early trance hits: go big or go home. It's an impulse he's honed even as he's backpedaled from his early recordings: see his skyscraping <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jmZTtFxcUg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">remix</a> of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1658-nathan-fake/\" target=\"_blank\">Nathan Fake</a>'s \"The Sky Was Pink\". Holden's second album, <i>The Inheritors</i>, is a raging bonfire of electro-acoustic composition. His kindling is the open-field psychedelia of groups like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/\" target=\"_blank\">Cluster</a> and Popol Vuh, with a healthy amount of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/\" target=\"_blank\">Boards of Canada</a>'s dusty gaze. Broken into 15 tracks but playing like a long, evolving piece, <i>The Inheritors</i> oscillates between buzzy pastoral beauty and harsh rhythmic duress. It's the sound of an artist uniquely in tune with his instrument, as Holden coaxes all manner of beastly noise out of his mighty modular synthesizer, trying to keep that sound organized and only sometimes succeeding.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Holden takes advantage of that instrument-- essentially a bespoke synthesis engine adapted for each track, aided by software Holden writes himself-- by embracing its imprecision. He recorded his curdling circuitry live, capturing plenty of pots and divots in the process, which gives <i>The Inheritors</i> a savage and craggy feel. If Boards of Canada evoke the beauty and majesty of the rolling countryside, Holden is puts you in direct contact with it, forcing you to engage its uneven terrain and irregular placements. This comes through on tracks like \"The Illuminations\", on which pretty, circular patterns are interrupted by haphazard distortion and chords are held to the speaker's breaking point.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">In most electronic music, the core elements-- drums, bassline, lead-- play well-defined roles and inhabit familiar sonic spaces. <i>The Inheritors</i> doesn't work like that. The rhythms and melodies come from odd places, sometimes switching roles during the course of a song. The title track, for example, is a hurricane of sound, sharp percussive hits fighting back a massive, distorted midrange assault. When Holden does break out traditional drum sounds-- during the climax of lead single <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15428-renata/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Renata\"</a> or \"Delabole\", for example-- they amplify the intensity, offering the gargled synth patterns something to spring from. <i>The Inheritors</i> comes to a head with \"Gone Feral\" and the title track, a sequence during which Holden unleashes his circuity and records the carnage. The hissing, buckling oscillations during this stretch wipe clean the careful pacing of tracks like \"Inter-City 125\" and \"Rannoch Dawn\". When he dials it down afterwards he has a sense of humor about it: \"Some Respite\".</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">It's difficult to describe the sound of <i>The Inheritors</i> without coming off like an analog apologist. But turn a track like \"Blackpool Late Eightes\"-- the penultimate and longest track, which acts as something of a victory lap-- up on a good system and you can feel its humming warmth, the air it browbeats around the room. You can imagine a shamanic Holden working amidst his machines, alternately reigning them in and provoking them. After dozens of listens, <i>The Inheritors</i> still feels like it could fall off the rails at any moment, that its wires could trip and the whole album devolve into a mess of feedback that will have you racing to unplug your speakers. Holden's ability to wrangle a complex synthesizer isn't unique; his ability to make that skill seem utterly necessary, is. </p>\n"], ["title", "James Holden: The Inheritors"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18184-james-holden-the-inheritors/"]]

Produced by an unknown Portuguese duo named Mendes &amp; Alçada, they had but that lone single to their credit. A bit of digging revealed that one half of that duo, Tiago Miranda, was quite a busy producer in his own right. Soon after, his tracks turned up on labels ranging from Italians Do It Better to Japan’s Ene, from Prins Thomas’ Internasjonal Spesial to DFA, while his band <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30322-gala-drop/\" target=\"_blank\">Gala Drop</a> was beginning to garner some notice as well (though Miranda has since left that group). While the labels may have been varied, Tiago's adept nature for crafting tracks that could be leftfield disco, acid, or psychedelic dub house connected them all.</p> <p><i>Ecstasy &amp; Release</i>-- released under the name TNT Subhead-- marks Miranda's first full-length effort. But his name appears nowhere on the album sleeve or on the record labels; there are no credits whatsoever. And judging by the cover art, it looks more like a lost agitprop 80s post-punk record than something suited for dancing. It seems destined to be mis-filed, which may be what Miranda wants.</p> <p>The music itself seems unwilling to be beholden to any one genre. Opener “Story of the Eye” namechecks the sexually-kinked novella by Georges Bataille, but favors the smooth minimal pulses of something like Steve Reich's <i>Music for 18 Musicians</i>, bolstered with chimes, rattles, and some live drums. The textures are enthralling although the track builds only to drain away slowly. The incessant, anxious hi-hats on “Can’t Relax” fall somewhere between “Vote for Miles” and “Someone Great” and make the song feel overly caffeinated and on-edge.</p> <p>It leads into the album’s squelching standout track, “Icelberg”, which thrills even though it never quite settles into being electro or acid, its icy arpeggios meeting a heavily-reverbed guitar line that warms it ever so slightly. The title track repeats “We all need love” ad infinitum, giving it the feel of an early Chicago house track, though the rock guitar nudges it beyond simple pastiche.</p> <p>The second half of the album brightens its tone ever so slightly. “Think of Sex But Not of You” uses a bowed cello and a stand-up bass line to erect a sleek and spacy house track out, soon building up enough steam to sound like one of Larry Heard’s more jazz-tinged productions. A more primitive drum machine pushes “The Book of Yes” along, adding analog synth gurgles, bloops, and a touch of acid along the way.</p> <p>It sounds like Miranda repurposed the acid line he deployed on his excellent leftfield 2010 single “Motorcycles” (a track that James Murphy played out often at that time) for penultimate track, “Arp K Found”. Yanking out the live drums and churning guitar line of the original and layering more synth washes across it instead, it doesn’t work quite as well.<i> Ecstasy &amp; Release</i> makes me pine for a compilation that might truly bring all of Miranda's myriad productions in one handy package. But as a debut, it's an encouraging sign, no matter what genre he decides to go into next.</p>\n"], ["title", "TNT Subhead: Ecstasy & Release"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18218-tnt-subhead-ecstasy-release/"]]

Earlier this year, the former began distributing releases from the latter, a partnership that produced<i> </i><i>Anthology</i>. It was curated from the 40+ tapes that Boothe's released on his <a href=\"http://gloof.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bandcamp</a> page in the past four years (including at least seven from 2013), clearly assembled by someone familiar with the best of Knx.’s catalogue. While it eschews the pop remixes that might entice listeners in favor of deeper cuts, its 53 short pieces (most falling between one and two minutes) provide a fine introduction to an enormous, if capricious, talent.</p> <p>Knx. rejects the free release schedule that so many in the hip-hop community have embraced, which is likely the reason he remains relatively obscure-- his bandcamp mixes, at $5 a pop, are out of your standard internet-comber’s price range. But while post-Dilla beatmaking fervor has reached its highest point, there’s certainly room to be made for a producer steeped in the history of black music and still with it enough to put out remixes of <a href=\"pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/\" target=\"_blank\">Drake</a>, <a href=\"pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel/\" target=\"_blank\">Miguel</a>, and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/\" target=\"_blank\">Danny Brown</a>.</p> <p>The tracks on <i>Anthology</i> don't make it as easy for sample-spotters as on some of Knxledge's past releases. For every Jadakiss ad-lib, every <i>Illmatic </i>skit, there’s an unrecognizable treatment of Camp Lo’s “Luchini AK (This Is It)” or a magical horn salvo like the one on “Pho”. Creating collages from the unfamiliar helps to show the fallacy in thinking of this kind of music as unoriginal, while also adding to Knx.’s legend as a prodigious crate-digger-- a snippet from an episode of \"What’s Happening\" on “Rude” is a perfect find for the track’s dreamy mix. Just as attractive is the beatmaker’s lack of snobbery: one of the best tracks here “[Lets]TalkAbtit” samples liberally from Tori Kelly, an amateur artist best known from <i>America’s Most Talented Kids, </i>and later on, “TooKlose[latensi]” is a remix of Next’s <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwEZRPkAAu8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">famous warning</a><i>.</i></p> <p>Comparisons between <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/\" target=\"_blank\">Madlib</a> and Knx. are inevitable as both artists are reclusive and prolific, with more interest in churning out beat after jazzy beat than classifying their music. But there are some key differences. Madlib, as befits Stones Throw's flagship artist, is more polished, his music more holistic, with a better eye for tracks that make sense together. He’s also more exploratory, constantly ranging to different countries and genres, and ocasionally to different personalities, in search of new inspiration. By contrast Knxledge doesn’t seem as interested in albums (he’s more taken with EPs) and his tracks often have little in common from one to the next. He’s firmly ensconced within the world of black American music, and has more interest in sampling and remixing contemporary sounds than Madlib does.</p> <p>None of which is to say that fans of the former will have anything against the latter. Both are shining examples of an artistic type that seems increasingly rare. (Though, admittedly it can be difficult to get a tally of artistic shut-ins.) A <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/nyregion/discovered-at-64-a-brooklyn-artist-takes-his-place.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent article</a> in the New York Times highlighted another of their kin, a Brooklyn artist named Rafael Leonardo Black, who has been steadily making art for three decades in near total seclusion. Black was quoted as saying that “people who become what are called artists don’t stop.” <i>Anthology </i>demonstrates about as well as any of his other releases that Knx. is a consummate artist.</p>\n"], ["title", "Knx: Anthology"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18237-knx-anthology/"]]

Instrumentally it’s an electro pop stan’s dream, gloriously cheesy in all the right places. “Sweet” and “Teenage Tiger Cat” fare similarly; expansive cinematics with casually provocative snares that break into relentless bass and bop-along electric guitar. The problem with both tracks, however, remains the total lack of vocal prowess. Sure there are growls on “Teenage Tiger Cat”, but what’s meant to sound like ‘tude or luring temptation mostly comes off as a starlet attempting to seduce a fan who has forgotten she exists.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Sentimental ballads show up frequently on <i>Planta</i>, earnestly declaring love and unearthing secret admiration. “Faith In Love” is the least trying because it’s different, a drone of organs and haze-clearing tambourine fades the album out. But its sleepiness is where we’re continuously lost; the singer’s vocals get swallowed by her surroundings, making something that could have been heart-tugging and lovelorn into a song that sounds bored with itself. The group could take a lesson in ferocity from <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/26934-gossip/\" target=\"_blank\">Gossip</a>’s Beth Ditto, who appears on the album opposite to Lovefoxxx on the hook of “Dynamite”. It’s the best track on the album next to “Hangover” if only because it’s actually got some life to it.

Its highlights are tracks that become memorable after multiple listens but are just as easily tuned out: the Karen O-sampling <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13317-wait/\">\"Wait\"</a>, \"Autumn\", and Blake collaboration \"Knives\", whose contorted gospel keyboard progressions are mixed under so much atmosphere they're practically subliminal.</p> <p>In a recent Pitchfork <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9142-airhead/\">interview</a>, McAdams said that he spent a lot of time growing up listening to music while sitting in front of a computer, \"which I'm sure [the music] wasn't intended for\". Consciously or not, it's a relationship to sound that has seeped completely into <i>For Years</i>, which has an even-keel, almost analgesic quality when played in the background of otherwise uneventful moments.</p> <p>It takes skill to make music this way-- to exist without disturbing, to engage without interrupting, and to please without sounding like you're going out of your way to do it. But there are tracks on <i>For Years</i> that feel like 30-second ideas stretched to four minutes, or where the music becomes so airy and loose I wonder if even McAdams is convinced it absolutely needs to exist. Ironically, what drew me to <i>For Years</i> on first listen is what held me back on the tenth: Despite its clever syntheses, there are times when it's not much more than pretty.</p> <p>But the good is not only good, it's promising. Some of <i>For Years</i> was recorded as early as 2009, and McAndrews expressed no interest in changing how he makes music in order to keep so-called pace with his peers. That's noble. His earliest singles-- \"Paper Street\" and the Blake collaborations \"Pembroke\" and \"Lock in the Lion\"-- still have an isolated, thrillingly idiosyncratic sound, like blueprints for buildings that nobody ever got around to. Think of <i>For Years</i> as a brick.</p>\n"], ["title", "Airhead: For Years"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18164-airhead-for-years/"]]

The connection makes a kind of retroactive sense going back to their early 2000s solo debuts, <i>Fantastic Damage</i> and <i>Monster</i>. Both albums seethed with the anxious funk of retrofuture 808s-and-synths production that rattled trunks and cages with unrestrained intensity. And both portrayed the artists as out-of-control forces trying their damnedest to stay true to friends, family, and hip-hop while confronting disenfranchisement, abuse, and cynicism. That their creators would gravitate towards collaboration makes even more sense now than it does with hindsight in mind, as the 1-2 hooks to the head of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16641-cancer-for-cure/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Cancer for Cure</i></a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16537-killer-mike-rap-music/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>R.A.P. Music</i></a> shared not just a producer and a timeframe, but the kind of catharsis-fueled defiance that career no-sellout vets live and breathe.</p> <p>Thankfully, El-P and Killer Mike made a point to keep working together, and by all accounts their two-MCs/one-producer teamup <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/51324-download-killer-mike-and-el-ps-run-the-jewels-album/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Run the Jewels</i></a> was meant to be some kind of “cool-down” record-- just something they could brainstorm up and record as a sort of fun, no-stress victory lap in celebration of a triumphant 2012. But if that kind of session reads as a low-stakes slack-off, especially in the form of a free 33-minute download, keep in mind just what constitutes “fun” for these guys. At the top of the list, it's the process-- workshopping ideas, putting things together, delivering them with conviction, and bringing it out to a rampant fanbase prone to drawing <a href=\"http://el-p.tumblr.com/post/53858236636/more-run-the-jewels-greatness-from-sawbrey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">irreverent fan-art</a> and <a href=\"http://store.foolsgoldrecs.com/products/run-the-jewels-grinder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ordering special-edition herb grinders</a>. No excuse to relax here.</p> <p>The only significant sign that El-P and Killer Mike are taking things “easier” on this album is the focus on shit-talk: aside from the confessional coming-of-age self-pep talk of closer “A Christmas Fucking Miracle”, there's little-to-no high-concept storytelling and a minimum of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13626-reagan/\" target=\"_blank\">“Reagan”</a>/”Drones Over Bklyn”-style political science. They haven't gotten complacent-- that latter song gets fleetingly referenced in a Mike line on “DDFH”, one of the few verses that catches the same police-state anger that <i>R.A.P. Music </i>did. And El still raps like somebody who's not sure if he's the last sane man or the craziest man on earth, carrying his refined maniacal diatribes over from <i>Cancer for Cure</i>. But the majority of <i>Run the Jewels </i>is a succession of throw-shit-out-a-window anthems which take the early-LL knuckles-first bragging that inspired the name, running their own psilocybin-tinged mean streak through it.</p> <p>The deepest messages of <i>Run the Jewels </i>are the ones dedicated to figuring out just how many ways there are to threaten bodily trauma in the most over-the-top language possible while not actually coming across like some screwfaced shock-value manchild. It feels as though the options of either catching a bad one or riding with them are easier to decide between because the latter sounds like it'd be a hell of a time anyways. And there's this sense of friendly, unspoken one-upsmanship between the two MCs that keeps upping the stakes. Mike on the title track: “I'll pull this pistol, put it on your poodle or your fuckin' baby.” El on “Sea Legs”: “Try to pet my fuckin' head again and I'm'a put a tooth through the flesh of the palm that you jack with.” Mike on <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15377-run-the-jewels-get-it/\" target=\"_blank\">“Get It”</a>: “stupid goofy stoolie, the gooch in Gucci will slap you/ and that go for the cop-kissing cats that's in the back of you.” El on “Twin Hype Back”: “Me and Mike'll go Twin Hype and do a dance on your windpipe/ put your fuckin' jazz hands back in your pants or get them shits sliced.” It's a game of the dozens where the barbs are aimed outwards and funny-looking moms are swapped for an all-encompassing People Who Fuck With Us category.</p> <p>In the process, both MCs have both started to meet each other halfway personality-wise, though that wasn't a long trip to begin with. El's panic-attack rasp has grown into this fluid delivery that's become as immersive as his older hitched-timing flow was, spitting slick bars and doubletimes that make the acidic comedy roll out like his own take on vintage Ludacris. And Mike maintains his wrecking-ball mode, but twists it into moments of psychedelic delirium and over-the-top throat tearing, a man incapable of sounding nonchalant about anything getting the chance to turn that elbow-throwing flow into the narrator for a story about getting a lapdance on mushrooms (“No Come Down”) or turning it up to the breaking point on the grimy Tyson-isms of “Job Well Done”. When they get into verse-swapping back-and-forths on “Twin Hype Back”, “Get It”, and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/50971-listen-el-p-killer-mike-and-big-boi-banana-clipper/\" target=\"_blank\">“Banana Clipper”</a> (where an otherwise excellent Big Boi verse bizarrely feels like an afterthought in comparison), or throw around conversational line-finishing asides elsewhere, the rapport's enough to raise questions as to why this teamup was supposed to be unusual in the first place.</p> <p>This is hardhead music, but it's also supposed to be a good time-- shit, they even brought in Prince Paul to do his oily weirdo pick-up artist Chest Rockwell routine on “Twin Hype Back”. (“I got your glass of Beefeater, I got a brand new deck of Uno cards... how 'bout I come over tonight and pick you up in my brand new Segway?”) So El-P pulls out the stops in making the abrasive, heavy aspects of his production sound boombox-ready. If this stuff's “dystopian,” you might as well book a party bus to Airstrip One: growling synthesized basslines do the heavy lifting as percussion skitters beneath like warped distortions of the 84, 96, and 02 versions of analog hip-hop, a cohesive sound that serves as a reminder that Georgia and New York are both technically East Coast. El's signature production touches-- minor-key chord drones, ligament-snapping guitar squalls, highwire arpeggios, twitchy drum patterns that are as restless as a rock-solid beat can get-- are put to pretty straightforward use this time around.</p> <p>The beats fit the blueprint of <i>R.A.P. Music</i>'s tendency to let the voices supply most of the brute force; it still bumps like a bastard, but not in the kind of way that had <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Yeezus </i></a>casualties scrambling for punk rock namedrops. It's just a distilled take on everything that made last year's albums such an event, with all the chrome ripped off and upholstery pulled out so it'll run faster, louder, nastier. Yeah, it's a fun album, and it's probably the most affable thing they've done so far together. But don't take that for a weakness. They don't yank chains-- they snatch them.</p>\n"], ["title", "Run the Jewels: Run the Jewels"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18219-run-the-jewels-run-the-jewels/"]]

It was a couple years after the overthrow of Haile Selassie by Mengistu Haile Mariam, and Mengistu’s Derg government had applied the brakes to Addis Ababa’s nightlife, making it much harder for a working band to make a living. Music was still being made in abundance, though, and cassettes ultimately made it a lot easier to duplicate and distribute it. “Muziqawi Silt” surfaced in collector circles in the U.S. and Europe in the 90s and was canonized by a 2003 <i>Ethiopiques</i> volume, and it’s since become one of the tiny handful of songs that non-Ethiopians use as a gateway into the country’s music. Antibalas even covered it. </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"><a href=\"pitchfork.com/artists/31413-hailu-mergia/\">Hailu Mergia</a> was the keyboardist for Walias Band. His organ playing is one of the only things a lot of people know about Ethiopian music. Walias Band was more important than just that one track, though. When the band arrived on the scene, the typical arrangement was for the venue-- usually a hotel-- to provide a band with instruments. Walias broke that mold by buying their own and working out contracts with the venues they played. In the early 80s, during a tour of the United States, Mergia and a few other members decided not to return home. That was the end of the band, but they’d made their mark back home. </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">A few years after moving to the U.S., Mergia decided to record an album that merged the sounds of his youth with modern technology. Working alone, he assembled a drum machine, a Rhodes piano, a Yamaha DX7, and his accordion, and got to work arranging old Ethiopian songs for this mostly modern palette. The results are striking and unusual. If <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/\" target=\"_blank\">Cluster</a> had been from Ethiopia instead of Germany, this is probably about what they would have sounded like. Mergia uses the Yamaha to make his buzzy bass lines, fills in chords and texture with the Rhodes, and then solos over the top, alternately on the accordion or the Yamaha DX7, in an inimitably Ethiopian style. The sound is spare and unaffected, the drum programming never deviating during any song, though he sometimes augments the rhythmic push with vocals halfway between beatboxing and chanting.</p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">In addition to the fluttering modal melodies, there are other distinctly Ethiopian signatures running through the music, particularly in the triple meters and three-against-four rhythms of the songs. “Belew Beduby” stomps along on a swaying polyrhythm on a par with anything you’ll hear from early 70s Addis, while “Hebo Lale” modifies that beat a bit for more of a boogie feel, aided by a faster tempo. At the other end of the spectrum, “Sewnetuwa” drifts along on an almost eight-bit-sounding bass line, with Yamaha DX7 and accordion dueling on top.</p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">The overall effect of the album is difficult to describe. The music is simple and straightforward, accomplished but not showy. It feels at once rural, nostalgic, and futuristic. Replace the drum machine with people clapping, and you’d be a hair’s breadth from an ethnographic recording. Drum machines and synthesizers are common ingredients of Ethiopian pop music today, but not in the same way they’re used here. Perhaps one of the things that sets this apart from other Ethiopian pop music is the fact that it was made in solitude, and specifically out of longing for a vanished past. It’s introverted in a way very little other music from the country is. It’s also not quite like anything else you’ve ever heard.</p>\n"], ["title", "Hailu Mergia: Hailu Mergia and His Classical Instrument"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18162-hailu-mergia-hailu-mergia-and-his-classical-instrument/"]]

This isn't to take away from the EPs and singles they released before this LP, because they contained good songs. It's just that they were still eclipsed by frontman Riley Gale and company's whirling dervish stage presence. There's a reason they've toured plenty with their west coast pals, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28767-trash-talk/\" target=\"_blank\">Trash Talk</a>: they play bridge shows, they make liberal use of gang vocals, their fans are very into circle pits, and, hell, they shout out straightedge hardcore bands on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/powertripT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">their Facebook page</a>. But this debut eight-song collection, their first release for Southern Lord, is such a strong record that you could never see Power Trip live and still understand what makes them special.</p> <p>The Dallas, TX, quintet play crossover, i.e. thrash that draws from hardcore punk. The guitars, placed up front, are clean, dexterous, and fast; the vocals and drums, in the back, are draped in sludge and reverb. Those elements will, at times, remind you of the darker side of the old-school thrash spectrum (<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/7559-slayer/\" target=\"_blank\">Slayer</a>), but the spirit of this stuff pulls more from the hardcore scene, like their Astoria forebears Leeway or, on the burlier side, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30560-cro-mags/\" target=\"_blank\">Cro-Mags</a>. Unlike other contemporary thrash bands, Power Trip create a legitimately violent atmosphere, and don't go around wearing sleeveless jean jackets with the front of their baseball caps turned up. They sound less like they're here to party, and more like they want to kick your ass.</p> <p>You could safely say Power Trip are a punk band. Their whiplash fight song, \"Power Trip\", includes the lines \"We ride as one/ We&#8217;re ruled by none,\" and you believe them.<i> Manifest </i>closer, \"The Hammer of Doubt\", was originally out, in different form, on a 2010 compilation called <i>America's Hardcore</i>. They've covered Prong. They could easily cover <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Flag</a>. They remind me of my early days in high school when I was coming out of a steady diet of hardcore and getting into bands like Metallica, D.R.I, Suicidal Tendencies, and Anthrax.</p> <p>The music on <i>Manifest Decimation</i> is bleak, dirty, heavy. It's also very catchy. At any given moment, Gale can sound like Lemmy fronting Cro-Mags, Discharge, or Exodus. At other times, he locates a grizzlier tone that evokes guys wearing corpsepaint. There are samples about death and Texas from movies like<i> Robocop 2</i> and <i>Blood Simple</i>. The Italian artist Paolo \"Madman\" Girardi offers detailed old school apocalyptic metal cover art. The lyrics deal with government and religious suppression like so: \"Histories trapped in illusion, who sees through who?/ For every mindless vision of who owns the truth/ For every one who spoke out, thousands were slain/ Torture and bloodshed in the sake of some holy name.\" That's the classic side of things, but while <i>Manifest Decimation</i> does sounds vintage (the chug-chug-chug, the whammy-bar abusing solos), these guys aren't stuck in 1986.</p> <p>What helps makes this album great, outside of the excellent riffs and choruses, is the way Power Trip mix in flourishes that place <i>Manifest Decimation</i> firmly in the present. (In that sense, you'll also think about another Texas band, the now defunct Iron Age.) There's nothing obvious; it's little touches, like the weirdo echo effect on Gale's voice throughout. The album opens with a blast of swirling feedback and ominous synth tones, something threaded throughout the album via brief, almost industrial snippets. The feeling's picked up in some of those headier vocal effects, too-- the phased pan on \"Conditioned to Death\" (which features some great early Metallica riffing), the disembodied backing vocals on the frantic \"Murderer's Row\" (complete with some Slayer-like soloing). It adds to the urgency and intensity, and also sets them apart. That said, none of it would matter if they weren't writing songs like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15272-power-trip-manifest-decimation/\" target=\"_blank\">the swarming title track</a> or the Mot&#246;rhead-banging \"Heretic's Fork\".</p> <p>Recently, people who take metal seriously have spent some time talking about whether or not thrash is dead, or if we're actually in the midst of a thrash revival. Power Trip have found a way to create something new by pulling from the past. In that way, it feels like they exist on both sides of the argument without giving a shit either way.</p>\n"], ["title", "Power Trip: Manifest Decimation"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17893-power-trip-manifest-decimation/"]]

His music has a similarly blinding elevator pitch quality: In just a few short years, the 23-year-old has assembled a formidable catalog of colorful, catchy, and impressive mixtapes. His latest, <i>Kilt 2</i>, doubles down on all of his strongest and most likeable qualities: Largely self-produced, high-energy, and creative, it shows Iamsu! continuing to transform from a promising, agreeable Bay Area rap figure into a burgeoning star.</p> <p>On <i>Kilt 2</i>, Su positions himself as an enterprising, funny young trend synthesizer, working hard to summarize the rowdy sprawl of his city's rap music riches and prep them for cross-country consumption. There are pieces of nearly every current Bay Area rap style floating through <i>Kilt</i>; DJ Mustard's infectiously bright and simple ratchet sound; hyphy, as the sound has come to be defined by <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1434-e-40/\" target=\"_blank\">E-40</a> over the past decade (\"On Citas,\" which brings Mistah F.A.B. and gravel-voiced Keak Da Sneak for good measure); the mournful, soul-inflected mob music of Husalah, Joe Blow, the Jacka and others in the Livewire/AR/Mob Figaz axis. \"The Science\", which overflows with wooly saxophone, talkbox, jazz flute, and grand piano, is a rich <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4883-dj-quik/\" target=\"_blank\">DJ Quik</a> homage. It sounds like an Easter Egg hunt meant only for Bay Area rap nerd-aficionados, but Su neatly corrals all of this context, shuffles it, and spits it out, stamped with earnest, clever, likeable raps. </p> <p>You could call it Su's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8767-the-college-dropout/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>College Dropout</i></a> impulse; he probably wouldn't mind. \"Found bravery in my bravado/ Trying to live up to that rapper from Chicago,\" he raps on \"The Science\". On \"Best Thing Yet\", he spells it out even more clearly: \"Bumpin <i>The College Dropout</i>, tryin' to rhyme like him,\" he says. Su has a few Westian qualities-- his ability, for one to treat the story of his rap career as an epic hero's journey, with or without the autobiographical nitty-gritty to sell it. \"I recognize the uncertainty of a career in music, but I still handle it perfectly, \" Su says on \"Citas\", and boasts on \"Father God\" that \"I could go my whole lifetime without your cosign.\" The quality he shares most with West, though, is his burning, evident desire to reach all demographics; on the feather-light \"Hipster Girls\", Su raps about Instagram likes and Tumblr posts, somehow without losing everyone in the room. \"Float\" and \"Let Go\" are pillowy, dazed love jams that gently bump pool rafts with <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/\" target=\"_blank\">Wiz Khalifa</a>.</p> <p>The production, when not handled directly by Su, comes from other members of his Invasion crew, a rotating cast of producers that have distinct specialties: P-Lo sources the spare, darker beats; the pinwheeling, airy numbers come from Kuya Beats. Iamsu!'s own production, however, is the most ambitious and musical-- his beat for \"On Citas\" melts, halfway through, into a second section of breathy female vocals and diaphanous keys. Even when it's dark and menacing, like \"Father God\", there is a nimble snap to Su's music. His reedy, modest voice makes him sound like a cousin to Khalifa, but his rapping is deceptively complicated, stepping nimbly in and out of double and triple time and running light, high-stepping circles around the beat. He's not quite charismatic enough yet to match his outsized ambitions, but <i>Kilt 2</i> is another solid step up his ladder. </p>\n"], ["title", "Iamsu!: Kilt II"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18236-iamsu-kilt-ii/"]]

Two years later, it’s safe to assume that anyone who still cares about either one of these guys would rather hear them together than on their own, trying in vain to compensate for the other brother’s absence.  </p> <p>But the Gallaghers are nothing if not stubborn, which means the world will have to wait at least one more album/tour cycle before the inevitable reunion cash-in. With Beady Eye’s new <i>BE</i>, Liam gamely goes through the motions of progressing beyond the rudimentary Oasisisms of <i>Different Gear </i>by employing <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/\" target=\"_blank\">TV on the Radio</a>’s Dave Sitek as producer<i>. </i>The results are about what you’d expect: <i>BE </i>is somewhat more adventurous than <i>Different Gear</i>, and certainly more dynamic. The horns laid over the menacing introduction of “Flick of the Finger” provide a touch of spice to Beady Eye’s meat-and-potatoes stew, and the ambient noise that pads out psych-tinged rockers like “Soul Love” ostensibly improves on the straight-forward lumbering that distinguishes long stretches of the first Beady Eye record. On paper, it’s a “better” album. So why is <i>BE </i>less enjoyable than <i>Different Gear</i>? Could it be that hiring a “smart” producer like Sitek was exactly the opposite of what this pleasurably dumb band requires?</p> <p>For all of the finesse that Sitek brings to <i>BE</i>, he might’ve been better off just making sure that the guitars were turned up loud enough. “I’m Just Saying” boasts the record’s most magnetic riff, clanking out of a burst of feedback and arrogantly barreling forward on supercharged power chords. It’s exactly the sort of song that should kill on a Beady Eye record, and yet on <i>BE </i>it’s a little too clean, even antiseptic. This is a band that needs to sound a little blurry and blown-out; Beady Eye’s broad strokes and bombastic flourishes are more satisfying when you can’t make out the specifics. Sitek’s pristine production only highlights how half-baked many of these songs are, especially lyrically. “Second Bite of the Apple” is a potentially fun snotball of classic Liam Gallagher insouciance, but lines like, “Shake my tree/ Where’s the apple for me/ Tickle my feet with the enemy” (or possibly, the <i>NME</i>)  are better when vaguely heard than comprehended.</p> <p>“Second Bite of the Apple” was written by Gem Archer, one-third of Beady Eye’s songwriting triumvirate that also includes Gallagher and Andy Bell. It’s a mild surprise that Gallagher’s songs are the best on <i>BE </i>in a walk-- it’s downright shocking how much he sounds like his brother on the pretty album closer “Start Anew”, a budget-minded “Champagne Supernova” with killer echo-y drum sounds lifted from John Lennon’s Phil Spector-produced solo records. If Liam seems hamstrung as a rocker on <i>BE, </i>at least he’s showing more promise as a balladeer. If that’s another ploy to convince Noel that he can be replaced, and therefore should cancel this solo career silliness and revive Oasis, <i>BE </i>might serve a purpose after all.</p>\n"], ["title", "Beady Eye: BE"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18206-beady-eye-be/"]]

There were echoes of a once-thriving industry in there, harking back to a time of money being endlessly funneled into lavish studio complexes, sometimes in aid of wild vanity projects. <i>RAM</i> added a whole other level of expenditure in service of the concept of retro. You can buy all the vintage amps and instruments you want, loot endless thrift stores to get just the right period ruffle on your shirt. But can you hire the guy who played drums on <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/\">Michael Jackson</a>'s <i>Off the Wall</i>? In a sense it's a grand folly, an ill-fitting match for the way music is mostly consumed at this point in time. You're not likely to hear the nuances of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ludwig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bob Ludwig</a>'s mastering job through tinny laptop speakers, crappy earbuds, low bitrate MP3s, and streaming YouTube clips.</p> <p>Of course the sheer ambition of <i>RAM</i> is a large part of its appeal, a big group purposefully acting big to flesh out the music as they imagine it in their heads. <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29422-nicolas-jaar/\">Nicolas Jaar</a>'s <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30070-darkside/\">Darkside</a> project, here renamed Daftside, take all that aspiration and siphon out every drop of it from the original source. This album, really just a series of clips uploaded to <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/51260-listen-darkside-nicolas-jaar-remixes-daft-punks-random-access-memories-in-full/\">Soundcloud</a>, remixes <i>RAM</i> in full, deconstructing it to resemble a thin, hollowed-out version of its original self. It's an internet-redux model of Daft Punk's work, a scratchy counterpart that sees virtue in the kind of ultra-low production values and consumption models that <i>RAM</i> veers away from. The first half of Daftside's \"Give Life Back to Music\" is positively emaciated, its drums falling flat, its cymbal splashes resembling old Casio presets caked in cheap distortion. It's the kind of thing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_JR_Robinson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">John \"J.R.\" Robinson</a>, Daft Punk’s ludicrously accomplished drummer on the original track, must have nightmares about.</p> <p>It's difficult to judge exactly how long Jaar and his musical partner, <a href=\"http://harringtone.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dave Harrington</a>, spent on this work (probably not much, considering how quickly they turned it around). So the tweaking is minimal at times, with pitches shifted resolutely down and that crackly flimsiness recurring as a theme. There was already something of a sad-robot motif to some of <i>RAM</i>, and the downturned atmosphere here emphasizes it further. \"Get Lucky\" sounds positively bluesy at times, with <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/\">Pharrell</a>'s vocal reduced to a drunken slur, making its central refrain sound more like a lost hope than a promise of good times ahead. It's indicative of this project's inclination for taking big moments and making them small, pushing them inward. Even <i>RAM</i>'s centerpiece, the Paul Williams-fronted \"Touch\", is pulled out of its its wide open space, given a minimal techno makeover, then shunted to the penultimate slot in the running order.</p> <p>Daftside's ability to find something else in this music doesn't just stretch to them reducing the mood to a set of internal post-club jams. At times they're looking for the direct inverse in mood, turning the gloomy \"Game of Love\" up in pace so it resembles a shuffling disco tune. For \"Contact\" they open with a gnarled take on the noise bursts at its close, placing it at the start of the tracklisting in a move that mirrors <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/\">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>'s positioning of the similarly bracing wake-up call \"Nil Admirari\" on <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14326-returnal/\"><i>Returnal</i></a>. Surprisingly, the material that seems more in Jaar's orbit-- the slow-build electronics of \"Motherboard\", the pulsing \"Giorgio by Moroder\"-- produce less satisfying results, with the former a mess of runaway electronics and the latter a tangle of empty loops. \"Doin' It Right\" is better, taking <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/\">Panda Bear</a>'s escalating vocal and turning it into a wonderfully ugly set of belches.</p> <p>Amusingly, for something that often deliberately drags so hard, Daftside simply brush over one of the <i>RAM</i> tracks that taps into that mood, turning the indifferent \"Lose Yourself to Dance\" into a two-second vocal passage then moving on. That sense of play, resembling Jaar and Harrington poking Daft Punk with a stick then gleefully running away, is partly what makes this a far greater work than standard remix albums. At times they're looking for nuances in the original, small threads they can pick up and take somewhere else. Elsewhere they're just having fun, acting on instincts, never over-awed by the material. Certainly there's an overall feel of taking all of Daft Punk's expansion and turning in a low-rent version of it, an Off-Off-Broadway version constructed in a cardboard pyramid patched together with tape and glue. Jaar's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15122-space-is-only-noise/\"><i>Space is Only Noise</i></a> worked from a similar mix of nuttiness and constraint. Somehow, he found a way back there through a most unlikely route.</p>\n"], ["title", "Daftside: Random Access Memories Memories"], ["updated_at", Tue, 09 Jul 2013 12:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18243-daftside-random-access-memories-memories/"]]
