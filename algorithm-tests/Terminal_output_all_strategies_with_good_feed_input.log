Smith</a>, it was only in the 1990s that German rock band <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/\" target=\"_blank\">Can</a> assumed its rightful place in the canon alongside the likes of the Beatles, Rolling Stones and Velvet Underground. One might even contend that Can’s emphasis on collaging and editing their improvised music (courtesy of bassist/producer Holger Czukay), all of it tethered to drummer Jaki Liebezeit’s relentless rhythms, exert far more influence on 21<sup>st</sup> century music than any of the aforementioned acts. Iconic bands such as <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/\" target=\"_blank\">Sonic Youth</a>, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/\" target=\"_blank\">Radiohead</a>, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/\" target=\"_blank\">Tortoise</a>, and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/\" target=\"_blank\">Stereolab</a> remain deeply in their debt; same goes for massively influential producers like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/851-carl-craig/\" target=\"_blank\">Carl Craig</a>, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Eno</a>, and François Kevorkian (all of whom remixed Can’s music on the 1997 compilation, <i>Sacrilege</i>).</p> <p>Even after the band dissolved, vital music continued to issue forth from its members: Holger Czukay’s solo albums from the 80s are well-worth investigating (as is the dark murmuring album he made with punk band <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/SYPH-SYPH/release/887484%5D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">S.Y.P.H.</a>), as is the music Liebezeit helmed in the Phantom Band and as part of Dunkelziffer, a curious Can offshoot.</p> <p>Some nineteen different players are credited on <i>Retrospection</i>, the first overview of the Köln-based collective that arose in the wake of Can’s demise. In addition to the core group of Dominik Von Senger, Matthias Keul, Olek Gelba, Reiner Linke, and Stefan Krachten, it also featured late-era Can members like Rebop Kwaku Baahchaz and Rosko Gee (both of whom were also members of Traffic), as well as contributions from Liebezeit and Damo Suzuki. Available both digitally and as a 3-LP set, <i>Retrospection</i> cherrypicks from the group’s 80’s output, a four album run starting with 1983’s <i>Colours and Soul</i> and ending with 1989’s <i>Songs for Everyone</i>.</p> <p>First song “This is How You Came” features tropical sound effects, some baby talk, and a lush polyrhythmic groove with extra hand percussion, while the next song, “Q” detours into the strangely lush world of Ryiuchi Sakamoto-styled gloss and early 80s sax, a strain of smooth jazz made all the stranger by Suzuki’s brand of pillow talk. On the 13-minute sprawl of “Retrospection\", the groove is decidedly more AOR rock-based, with Suzuki’s deeper vocals grappling with Wolfgang Schubert’s saxophone. If you ever wondered what it might sound like if the horn from <a href=\"http://youtu.be/81H2TYkXZwY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">“Baker Street”</a> wandered onto <i>Ege Bamyasi</i>, here is the closest approximation of that trainwreck.</p> <p>But as odd a fit as such rock moves can sound, it’s when grotesque-seeming genres like “Teutonic reggae” and “Kosmische-fusion” appear that the set intrigues. “Keine Python” has the skip and bounce of turn-of-decade reggae (think of Sly &amp; Robbie’s Taxi productions) with vocalist Coco Claus yipping like Ari Up as Berliner. “Network” finds the group mimic Weather Report via Schubert’s processed horn and Krachten’s shuffling drum patterns while Suzuki scats amid the slick fusion.</p> <p>The highlight of the vinyl set for me occurs on the second 12”. It opens with “Trailer II\", coupling a martial beat of “Sunday Bloody Sunday” with a bass throb like something emanating from <i>Metal Box</i>. With Suzuki’s inexplicable muttering on top, it makes for a sinuous and intoxicating dark disco track. The taut and vivacious “Bleib Nicht So Lang Im Schatten Stehn” shows that Dunkelziffer could also make boisterous femme-fronted new wave with Claus, too. Uneven at times, its sleekness sometimes to the point of sounding oily, <i>Retrospection</i> will still reward and satisfy Can fans, showing how their DNA continued to mutate the music of their homeland even after they had disbanded.</p>\n"], ["title", "Dunkelziffer: Retrospection (Part 1, 2 & 3)"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18131-dunkelziffer-retrospection-part-1-2-3/"]]

This sound-- big waves of guitar bearing a small voice gently upward-- works a useful salve for loneliness, but it also sounds majestic ringing out over an open field at an outdoor festival; at its best, it feels timeless. <i>Destruction in Yr Soul</i>, the band's third full-length, aims higher and resonates more deeply than 2011's <i>Lonely Twin</i>: Supplied with rich, cavernous production, Ships bandleader Jordan Geiger manages to stir some of the grand feelings of his idols.</p> <p>These eight songs have simple, hulking structures, rising tall and plain like grain silos. Opener \"Come Back to Life\" is fitted with a frame of two chords, a pounding bass drum, two bass notes, and not much else, all of them spaced miles apart. Into this empty space, Geiger pours keening guitar leads, billowing blasts of feedback, hammered piano octaves, and his frail voice, whispering a love song pricked by spiritual intimations: Lazarus, the shadow of death. The song has a hymnal, familiar feel-- \"Raise up my voice/ Into the night,\" Geiger sings at the outset.</p> <p>He wants these songs to feel like songs you've known your whole life, and when <i>Destruction</i> is really good, he manages to make you feel this way even when you can hear his inspirations coursing right beneath the surface. \"If It Speaks\" has a direct \"Neighborhood No. 1\" quote hidden right in its pulse, but Geiger doesn't let the echo of this larger song obscure his; he builds an anthem of his own right on top of it, making for maybe his best-ever song. \"I'm not strong, and I'm not proud/ But if it's strong, we can pull it down\", Geiger sings, upon which an enormous-sounding guitar cruises overhead like a UFO darkening the song's big Midwestern sky. </p> <p>Geiger opens \"If It Speaks\" by observing \"I am not/ The son of god/ And I am not the only one,\" and sometimes Hospital Ships resemble like a Christian rock band minus the overt dogma: He invites us to \"Let the dying world die, yeah just let it go\" on \"Joan of Arc\", and on \"Lost Folk Song\", he tells us \"I prayed my seed don't take no purchase in this land.\" Geiger's lyrics read like slogans plucked and arranged for maximum anthem potential more than like couplets or stories, but notes of redemption, destiny, and worldly transcendence pop up repeatedly. \"My cell phone won't stop ringing/ And the angels all are singing,\" he sings on \"Desolation Waltz\", chiding us gently that \"all your gold won't save your life\" on \"All Yr Gold\". </p> <p>The album's reverent tone, by the end, induces minor grandeur fatigue of the sort that <i>Man of Steel</i> viewers reported during the film's third hour. There aren't quite enough grace notes in Geiger's lyrics or songwriting yet to make you care deeply about this band. Who knows, though: Geiger made a quantum leap from <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15517-lonely-twin/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Lonely Twin</i></a> to this album. <i>Destruction In Yr Soul</i> isn't strikingly original, but it is heartfelt and comforting, and there is plenty of starlit sky here to stretch out beneath for those in search of it.</p>\n"], ["title", "Hospital Ships: Destruction in Yr Soul"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18174-hospital-ships-destruction-in-yr-soul/"]]

Their songs have a simplicity to them that makes it easy to imagine dozens of tracks being churned out in tape after tape. But what does it mean to be a band whose goals seem so relaxed and simple? What rubric do you use to evaluate a band who once boasted, “When she’s takin’ off my pants, I know what to do”?</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">You have to meet the Memories on their own turf. They made that task easy last year on their <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16880-the-memories/\">self-titled album</a>, which had a interesting production and a strange sort of charm. Those songs weren’t elaborate or eloquent, but what “Baby (You’re Totally Crazy)” lacked in complex sentiments, it compensated with lush instrumentation. When they made overt references to smoking pot, like on “Higher” and “Took Drugs (Went Insane)”, they complemented them with an appropriately mellow and ethereal atmosphere. In the aforementioned “I Know What to Do”, there’s a Southern rock guitar solo that's warm, simple and just clicks everything into place. This stuff is meant to be uncomplicated and breezy-- AM radio gold for the slacker set. But <i>Love is the Law</i>, which doesn't always stick to the beatific production of <i>The Memories</i>, proves that there’s a razor-thin line between sweetly simple and facepalmingly dumb.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><i>Love Is the Law </i>is 17 tracks long, most of which are shorter than two minutes. With this onslaught of ideas in rapid succession, it quickly reveals itself as a mixed bag. It's probably best to approach these songs with this formula in mind: Find the ratio of catchiness to cringeworthiness. Though the lyrics of \"En Espanol\" are rudimentary, the hook is catchy enough to latch onto and enjoy. If you're ready for a short \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a>\" goof, they've offered up the digestibly ridiculous ballad \"Like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Riker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Riker</a>\" (which they rhyme with \"I like her\").</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Like any \"Tim and Eric\" sketch, your reaction to this album will heavily depend on what you find funny. One of the most polarizing examples of this is \"You Need a Big Man\", which not only features lyrics that boast about having a large penis (\"a big man tough and a big man strong/ you need a big man thick and a big man long\"), but also a series of air guitar riffs sung in a weirdo twang. Obviously, this track's goal is to earn some laughs, and if this is something you can find a way to laugh at after you've heard it one time, then the song's catchiness will probably win you over. But I cannot imagine a similar fate befalling \"Go Down on You\", another admittedly catchy minute-long ditty with the inexcusable line \"I'd like a taste between your waist/ A sweet surprise between your thighs\".</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">But then just as easily, they can call back to what made <i>The Memories</i> an enjoyable record in the first place. \"Love Is Not a Dream\", \"I Remember You\", and \"Wasted All the Time\" pack some pleasant jangling atmosphere in for tracks that evoke the kind of warmth this album often strives for. Ultimately, though, it's hard actively want to listen to most of these songs. They're bite-sized enough that they should be like candy-- fun, sugary, easy, quick. Instead, there are several tracks here that make <i>Love is the L</i><i>aw</i> feel like a chore.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/burgerrecords/the-memories-en-espanol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">press release</a> for this album boasted that these tracks came from the band's memories, which means these musings on penis size, Riker, and cunnilingus are their sing-songy memoirs. It's the skeezy stoner version of using nostalgia as a lyrical hook. “We want people to hear these songs and remember their exes. We want people to remember things and smile. To remember and to savor the flavor,\" said Gage. And this is clearly something they intended for people to experience via a tape deck, preferably while stoned. So there's something about the Memories' <i>Love is the Law </i>mission statement that doesn't fully add up. They're targeting an audience of people who stereotypically listen to music that offers escapism of some kind, whether it's through psych, prog, reggae, hip-hop, ambient, or yes, Burger Records. And while these songs can occasionally find that perfect balance of catchiness, sweetly familiar sentiments, and home-recorded charm, there a few too many lemons for this to be a record worthy of vibing out.</p>\n"], ["title", "The Memories: Love is the Law"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18258-the-memories-love-is-the-law/"]]

(Or, rather, its companion, including some songs they started at the earlier sessions). It'se even more of a surprise that <i>Electric</i> is their most immediate, jubilant record in at least a decade-- a return to a couple of elements of their work that had been lying fallow for too long.</p> <p>Most notably, this is the first time in a while that Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe have borrowed from what's going on in dance clubs in the service of pop songwriting, with help from veteran producer Stuart Price. (\"Shouting in the Evening\" even nods to dubstep.) <i>Electric</i> isn't quite electrifying in the way that <i>Very</i> and <i>Introspective</i> and \"What Have I Done To Deserve This?\" are, but nearly every track has a moment or two that ignites seemingly long-gone enthusiasm.</p> <p>Sometimes, that's because the Boys are using specific tricks that have worked for them before. \"Love Is a Bourgeois Construct\" is another in their string of modified classical pieces, taking its countermelody from Henry Purcell's <i>King Arthur</i> (by way of Michael Nyman's \"Chasing Sheep Is Best Left to Shepherds\"), and its sour-grapes premise from a line in a David Lodge novel. And \"Thursday\" might have recalled 1986's \"Love Comes Quickly\" even without a synth-bass-and-bells introduction that makes it sound like that song's fraternal twin.</p> <p>The one thing Tennant and Lowe arguably do better than anyone else, though, is queering pop-- finding ways to recast seemingly sexuality-neutral musical ideas as specifically gay. \"Bolshy\"-- slang for \"uncooperative\" or \"belligerent,\" roughly-- isn't ordinarily a gendered word, but it sure is in the song by that name here, and its connotation of Bolsheviks fits in with the Pet Shop Boys' fascination with all things early-Soviet. <i>Electric</i>'s sole cover is a brilliant recontextualization: \"The Last to Die\" is a 2007 <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/\" target=\"_blank\">Bruce Springsteen</a> song, whose chorus quotes John Kerry's 1971 condemnation of the Vietnam war. Tennant and Lowe scarcely change a word of its lyrics, but arranged and sung as a Pet Shop Boys song, it abruptly and unmistakably becomes a song about gay culture's transition from the AIDS crisis of the \"West End Girls\" era to its current focus on domesticity. That's quite a feat.</p> <p>In place of the leavetakings of their past few albums' final tracks, <i>Electric</i> ends with \"Vocal\", a fantasy of hearing exactly the kind of music you've always wanted to hear, in the perfect club. \"I like the singer/ He's lonely and strange/ Every track has a vocal,\" Tennant muses in his lonely, strange voice. It's a bit unusual to hear so many vocal tracks in a club these days, he knows, but he's imagining that his songs could save some kid the way other people's songs once saved him.</p>\n"], ["title", "Pet Shop Boys: Electric"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18268-pet-shop-boys-electric/"]]

John Darnielle wrote most of the lyrics in the margins of the stapled, mimeographed handouts given to him in the orientation sessions at his new health-care job in Ames, Iowa. It was 1999. Every day he’d come home at three to an empty house, dishes crowding the sink (his wife was away at hockey camp) and pass the solitary evenings leafing through his handouts and editing the day’s work. When a melody came to him, he’d grab his guitar, mute the TV and hit the red button on a dying, decade-old boombox that had documented hundreds of similarly fractured, bleating folk songs since he began recording as <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2845-the-mountain-goats/\" target=\"_blank\">the Mountain Goats </a>in 1991.</p> <p>There were obstacles to recording this way-- sometimes the tape ran out mid-song, very occasionally the phone rang-- and once they were resolved, the composition in question had sometimes already fallen out of Darnielle’s favor. “In those days, a song got exactly one day in which to either resolve its issues or be cast forth from the company of its brethren,” he writes in the reissue’s liner notes. The lucky survivors, though, have a palpable immediacy. Most of the takes you hear on <i>All Hail West Texas </i>were recorded within hours (or, when the juices were really flowing, minutes) of being written.</p> <p>There’s a common misconception that all Mountain Goats records were recorded this way, but that’s not exactly true. Up until <i>All Hail West Texas</i>’s release in 2002, they were more like compilations-- collage-like assortments of bedroom recordings, live shows, occasional duets, radio broadcasts and four-tracked one-offs. The subject matter was sometimes bleak (especially the many songs that charted in stinging detail the doomed relationship of the fictional Alpha couple) but these variedly textured means of recording lent the albums a feeling of motion: Darnielle seemed more like an eccentric, town-to-town troubadour than an elusive bedroom-folk hermit. But not so on <i>All Hail West Texas</i>. Recording in suburban solitary confinement and exclusively on the boombox gives <i>All Hail</i> <i>West Texas</i> a cohesion and an echoing sense of isolation-- the perfect atmosphere for 14 songs about crushed dreams (“The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton”), long-distance longing (“Source Decay”), and occasional moments of piercing joy (“Jenny”).</p> <p>While recording <i>All Hail</i>, Darnielle did have a companion of sorts: his Panasonic RX-FT500, a temperamental machine so crucial to the album’s overall vibe that he credits it as a “second performer” in the liner notes. It had been out of commission for about two years (listening to the RX-FT500’s contributions to the Mountain Goats’ discography chronologically is kind of like listening to an alt-folk <i>Disintegration Loops</i>: you can practically chart its slow, gradual decay), but that fateful summer, it came back from the brink of death for an encore performance. “What you have with you now,” Darnielle writes on the inside sleeve, “[Is] the sound of a long-broken machine deciding, on its own and without the interference of repairmen or excessive prayer vigils, to function again.” And perhaps more than any other Mountain Goats record, you get a sense of this feeling in his voice, too: urgency, finality, and a twinge of superstition-- as though he’s not sure the “record” button will still be working by the next take.</p> <p>The first people we meet are Jeff and Cyrus, a pair of pentagram-doodling teenage metalheads with big dreams for their still-unnamed two-man band (though they’ve been arguing over a few possibilities: Satan’s Fingers, the Killers, the Hospital Bombers). They’re the stars of album opener “The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton” a song that, if not <i>the</i> definitive Mountain Goats song, at least deserves an undisputed mention in the top 5. This isn’t a statement you throw around lightly about a band this prolific, but “Denton” feels like a dizzyingly succinct crash course in everything that makes the Mountain Goats great. In just two-and-a-half minutes, Darnielle pulls off three whiplashing tonal shifts. It starts off seeming like a light, funny song about a couple of high school goofballs, but then-- with a simple, unexpected pivot in the chord progression—things turn suddenly poignant: the band and the boys’ friendship is abruptly interrupted when Cyrus gets sent to a boarding school-- or, as the now-ominous “Hospital Bombers” suggests, could it be a psychiatric facility?-- “where they told him he’d never be famous.” In its closing moments, though, it becomes defiant, triumphant battlecry: “When you punish a person for dreaming his dream/ Don’t expect him to thank or forgive you/ The best ever death metal band out of Denton/ Will in time both outpace and outlive you.” It’s brilliantly structured and smartly crafted, but it wouldn’t be half as stirring if it were recorded with more polish. “Denton” is an imperfectly sung ode to all the songs that don’t get sung because of the people who put into the singers’ heads that the only songs worth singing are the perfect ones.</p> <p>As advertised on its otherwise blank cover, <i>All Hail West Texas</i> is comprised of “fourteen songs about seven people, two houses, a motorcycle, and a locked treatment facility for adolescent boys.” The specificity of the narrative here is something of a joke: this was Darnielle’s first attempt at a concept album and-- somewhat paradoxically-- it succeeds mostly because of how loose the concept is. None of the other recurring characters get the first-name introductions that Jeff and Cyrus do, and it’s hard to follow which songs are about which of the seven people, or where one person ends and the other begins.</p> <p>But that’s the point-- and even the brilliance-- of <i>All Hail West Texas</i>. Darnielle finds the common humanity in the people he’s singing about, whether it’s the injured high school football star who accidentally sells acid to an undercover cop (“Fall of the High School Running Back”), the blissfully happy couple in “Jenny” or the thoroughly miserable one in “Fault Lines”. There’s no shortage of contenders for “most devastating moment on <i>All Hail West Texas</i>”, but my vote goes to the half-second beat between tracks 8 and 9, the tender “Riches and Wonders” (“We are strong, we are faithful, we are guardians of a rare thing…/ And we dance like drunken sailors, lost at sea, out of our minds”) and the searing pre-break-up travelogue “The Mess Inside” (“We went down to New Orleans one weekend in the spring/ Looked hard for what we’d lost/ It was painful to admit it, but we couldn’t find a thing”). Are these two songs about the same couple? The suggestion that they <i>could</i> be-- that the potent feeling captured in “Riches” is too often something fleeting-- stings worse than knowing for sure.</p> <p>As the Panasonic RX-FT500’s swansong, <i>All Hail West Texas</i> (which finally came out, first on cassette, in 2002) does mark the end of something fleeting, too. Later in 2002, Darnielle released the excellent <i>Tallahassee</i>-- not only the first “hi-fi” Mountain Goats record, but also the first in a series of concept albums that stick to much clearer narratives. But in the retrospective ruminations prompted by Merge’s new CD/LP reissue of this album, it feels less like a turning point in Darnielle’s career than an undeniable sweet spot. Mountain Goats fans are generally divided between the lo-fi diehards who champion the unpolished virtues of the early stuff and the people who prefer the more finely crafted later records. But <i>All Hail West Texas</i> (as well as the highlights of the previously unreleased material included with the reissue, like “Answering the Phone” and the proto-<i>Tallahassee</i> sketch “Indonesia”) is the best of both worlds: a snapshot of the moment when Darnielle had honed his lyrical and melodic sensibilities well enough to write songs as good as “Jenny” and “The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton”, but also perhaps before he actually realized how good and enduring these songs actually were.</p> <p>Revisiting <i>All Hail West Texas</i> over two decades into the Mountain Goats’ existence makes a central irony in their story all too clear: it’s not a lonely record anymore. A handful of these songs remain the most iconic in the Mountain Goats catalog, which-- thanks to Darnielle’s cult fanbase that seems to be steadily, improbably increasing with each year-- means that some of the lines that echoed off the empty walls that summer in Ames, Iowa have now been screamed by thousands and thousands of different people. When Darnielle put most of these songs to tape in 1999, even to his fans he seemed like someone who’d end up a committed but obscure lifer on the indie cassette circuit; it was hard to imagine there’d ever be a wide audience for the kind of eccentric, homespun music he was making. But remember: people underestimated Jeff and Cyrus, too.</p>\n"], ["title", "The Mountain Goats: All Hail West Texas"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18288-the-mountain-goats-all-hail-west-texas/"]]

It’s just her and a cello, improvising without overdubs or effects. The production is raw and immediate, putting you so close to her instrument you can practically see the divots in its strings. And the music is so impulsive and untamed that at times it feels like you’re hearing her nervous system. Lee has made intimate solo music before-- 2008’s <i><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12106-i-saw-the-ghost-of-an-unknown-soul-and-it-said/\">I Saw the Ghost of an Unknown Soul and It Said…</a> </i>is a highlight of her diverse discography-- but nothing so far has had the direct impact of <i>Ghil</i>.</p> <p>It turns out, though, that <i>Ghil </i>is actually a collaboration. Lee played all the sounds on the album, but they were recorded by Norwegian noise musician <a href=\"http://www.lassemarhaug.no/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lasse Marhaug</a>, whose ideas guided the project. Marhaug took Lee to numerous locations in Oslo and documented her improvisations with a cheap mic and a vintage 1976 tape deck. Lee calls Marhaug’s technique “expressionistic…the way he recorded was the closest way to how I 'feel’ when I play rather than how it 'sounds.’” The pair laid down nearly three hours of music this way, and Lee trusted Marhaug so much that she let him edit and sequence the results without hearing the full source material herself.</p> <p>That was a wise decision, because Marhaug did a masterful job of choosing and arranging Lee’s music. He maintains the sessions’ in-the-moment feel while crafting a progression that approaches narrative. <i>Ghil </i>is also remarkably varied for an album with such a consistent emotional tone. Though Lee always sounds like she’s playing on the edge of her seat, some of the music is hypnotic, with repetitions that encourage meditation; other sections dart around so quickly it’s like she's putting out fires in the corners of her mind. Tracks like the trebly “Meolly Ganeun” sound like a pedal-pushing noise band, while the cavernous “Hollow Water” and the growling “Two Perfectly Shaped Stones” build drones that seem beyond the capacity of a single instrument.</p> <p>If you’re unfamiliar with Lee’s work or improv in general, a good reference point for <i>Ghil </i>might be the saxophone workouts of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29454-colin-stetson/\">Colin Stetson</a>. Both he and Lee put physical effort into their music that in turn has a visceral effect on the listener. But where Stetson can drift toward calmer tones, Lee here is all about brute force-- sometimes at a frightening level. Take the ear-busting “Two to Your Right, Five to Your Left,” which evokes string sections from horror movie soundtracks shattered against each other.</p> <p>That thrill-ride aspect of <i>Ghil </i>is intoxicating, but its main strength is how it sounds both tactile and emotional-- both like natural phenomena and purposeful music. I often find myself fascinated by Lee’s textures and how she created them, but I never feel like I’m listening to field recordings or abstract art. That’s due to Lee’s pedigree as a composer and player-- she has a degree in music from Berklee, has accompanied <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/\">Laurie Anderson</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2132-vijay-iyer/\">Vijay Iyer</a>, and made two albums of precisely-arranged music for <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4725-john-zorn/\">John Zorn</a>’s Tzadik label.</p> <p>But when Marhaug asked her to record, Lee had reached a stage where she was thinking less about structure, preferring to “start totally blank and wait for something to tell me where to go.” The result is an album that somehow embraces music while it’s abandoning it. And whichever end of her spectrum Lee swings toward-- the harshly noisy or the hypnotically meditative-- her sound always commands attention, making <i>Ghil </i>the biggest surprise in a career already full of them. </p>\n"], ["title", "Okkyung Lee: Ghil"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18240-okkyung-lee-ghil/"]]

The band’s name, written in large white capital letters, stretches across the top of the record’s cover within a thick black bar; below, the album’s name, <i>Rebellion Hymns,</i> squeezes across the bottom, caps-lock again surrounded by black. The disc’s spine even co-opts the familiar Young God Records layout, with Profound Lore’s coat of arms and the album’s catalog number both offset in separate white boxes. Indeed, Michael Gira’s work, particularly as it bled in the late 90s from Swans into Angels of Light, offers a clear stylistic guide for Wunder’s own reflections on morality and morbidity. Like Gira, Wunder’s swollen, resonant bellow lifts lines about desperation, resignation, and perseverance above electrically charged acoustic music-- a bleak mirror image of typecast heaviness.</p> <p>Such a conspicuous reference to one of music’s great cult acts cuts both ways, of course. It situates <i>Rebellion Hymns</i> within a clear aesthetic framework, but it also sets a particularly heavy onus of expectation squarely at the feet of Man’s Gin. But by and large, Wunder proves to be a compelling songwriter and arranger, overhauling structures in ways that make it clear that Man’s Gin is neither mere obsequy or a vacuous side-project from a musician better-known for his role in Cobalt. Most often, <i>Rebellion Hymns</i> gathers itself into grand waves, with what might sound like folk or country tunes rising deliberately into dramatic crescendos. During album opener “Inspiration”, for instance, Wunder delivers a series of motivational credos (“Take a leaf off a tree and make it worth something”) over a steady rise in volume; by song’s end, he’s yelling his mantras, his voice straining and cracking over accordion, drums, and piano. The terrific <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15440-deer-head-the-rain/\" target=\"_blank\">“Deer Head &amp; the Rain”</a> pushes from a similarly polite mien to, four minutes later, a truly Swans-styled meanness, as Wunder shouts over cascading drums and guitars that surge through a thin scrim of dissonance.</p> <p>Such a songwriting script is a holdover from <i>Smiling Dogs</i>, Wunder’s previous and much more monotonous LP as Man’s Gin. On <i>Rebellion Hymns</i>, for better and worse, he strikes out in several new directions at once, aided again by the versatile backing band of Joshua Lozano and Scott Edward and contributions from a number of guests, including former Swan Jarboe and Cobalt’s other half, Phil McSorley. “Old House (Bark at the Moonwalk)” slyly approximates the shape of black metal with piano, its keys flickering quickly while the drums crack open behind it; a series of rhythmic switchbacks and momentum swings, “Old House” eventually peaks in a full sprint, with Wunder yelling over chaotic guitar and still-pounding piano. “Never Do the Neon Lights” pushes decidedly toward pop-rock, swiveling on a hook that’s perfectly sharp and strangely reassuring. Closer “Hibernation Time” is Wunder’s attempt to construct an acoustic doom epic, with the baritone saxophone of Yakuza’s Bruce Lamont smoldering beneath forlorn vocals and a curtain of neon noise.</p> <p>These are indeed intriguing moments, but as an hour-long, 12-track album, <i>Rebellion Hymns</i> fails to weave together the various and variably provocative threads that Wunder offers. The band flips from the plaintive acoustic croon of “Varicose” to the awkward gypsy folk growl of “Off The Coast of Sicily”, from the strangely bustling and winning grunge of “Never Do the Neon Lights” to the demented acoustic plod of “Deer Head &amp; the Rain”. The band scatters four instrumental interludes through the disc, too-- three are untitled, though the last and best is a candlelit piano dirge called “Cellar Door”. The scraped piano strings and aleatory percussion of the first and third such pieces and the asphyxiated guitar of the middle number are rather rote lifts of 20th century composition. More important, though, is that none of these wordless bits do anything to enhance the album as an experience or to help the tunes themselves make more sense as neighbors. Rather, they only sit in their places, unarticulated thoughts that never fell quite to the cutting-room floor.   </p> <p>Wunder’s voice doesn’t do him any favors here, either. He’s a terrific singer, with a deep tone that seems to bubble up from a pool of experience. But he wanders uncomfortably inside of it, alternately taking on the characters of Eddie Vedder, Mike Patton, Scott Kelly, Layne Staley, and, at certain points along the way, himself. Man’s Gin remains, then, the quintessential <i>other</i> band, functioning more as a reservoir for outlying ideas and accessorized themes than an outfit with a direct focus or aim. But even though <i>Rebellion Hymns </i>is less cohesive than <i>Smiling Dogs</i>, that’s because it’s more imaginative, suggesting that Wunder is slowly acclimating to his role as Man’s Gin singer, songwriter and-- most important-- bandleader<i>. </i></p>\n"], ["title", "Man's Gin: Rebellion Hymns"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18159-mans-gin-rebellion-hymns/"]]

His discography is so vast at this point, with so many notable collaborators picked up along the way, that even the most ardent krautrock obsessive probably doesn't own a complete set of his works. Roedelius is a founding member of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/\">Cluster</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/8797-harmonia/\">Harmonia</a>, and made a handful of recordings with <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/27520-cluster-eno/\">Brian Eno</a> in the 1970s. But that's just scratching the surface of his output. To help make sense of it all, the chronology section of Roedelius' <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Joachim_Roedelius\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia page</a> is split into seven eras, split across six decades. The last entry at the time of writing this review is his unlikely <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17767-lloyd-cole-hans-joachim-roedelius-selected-studies-vol-1/\">matchup</a> with English singer-songwriter <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/791-lloyd-cole/\">Lloyd Cole</a>. But Roedelius has already moved on from there, returning to <a href=\"http://www.bureau-b.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bureau B</a> for this collaboration with <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4250-to-rococo-rot/\">To Rococo Rot</a>/<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kreidler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kreidler</a> musician Stefan Schneider. Even this is likely to be old material now, with barely a speck of dust allowed to settle on Roedelius's console before he's off into the night, working elsewhere.</p> <p>At least this pairing makes some kind of sense, as it feels like Roedelius is working with someone who has the same inquisitive approach to electronic music as his own. Schneider's not adverse to stretching outside his comfort zone, either; To Rococo Rot are known for going out on a limb on occasion, even remixing fey indie-pop outfit <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3263-the-pastels/\">the Pastels</a>. Still, <i>Tiden</i> isn't a great leap for either musician, with Roedelius providing tasteful classical piano at all the right junctures, and Schneider simply credited with contributing \"Elektronik\". The mood is resolutely introspective, but positively light and breezy throughout. Even when they hit a downward curve there's an element stirred into the mix that lifts the mood. \"Toast\" looks to be circling the hauntology sub-genre at one point, but gets a decent amount of uplift via familiar post-rock elements provided (presumably) by Schneider.</p> <p>This isn't the first time this pair have collaborated, making it no surprise that there's a comfort to <i>Tiden</i> that replaces the stiffening that sometimes beset Roedelius's work with Cole. At times it's a little too casual, causing certain tracks to form an uneven shape somewhere between bland piano bar noodling and something genuinely pretty-- There's even a track titled \"Mild\". When they don’t follow straight lines, adding discordance to the mix, there's a richness that puts the meandering material in the shade. Those moments come when rhythms don't follow logical patterns, or a darker edge is cut into the electronic shapes. It lends a sense of parity between the men and their machines, a feeling of them relinquishing control and removing some of the tight parameters, just to see where it will take them.</p> <p>On <i>Tiden</i> it's mostly pretty easy to pull apart tracks and figure out who did what, although there's never a feeling of two figures resting on their laurels. Occasionally it's reminiscent of that moment in the 90s when indie-rock and electronic music got all jumbled up, leading to excellent collaborations such as the contribution <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2846-mouse-on-mars/\">Mouse on Mars</a> made to <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/\">Stereolab</a>'s <i>Dots and Loops</i>. There's an amusingly titled track called \"Indie Woogie\" that nods to that era, although here a greater sense of sadness prevails. Where <i>Dots and Loops</i> reeked of optimism, on \"Indie Woogie\" there's a feeling of dreams burning down, of promise not being fulfilled. It's atypical of the overall mood, but illustrates a depth away from the soft glow at this album's core. Roedelius's thoughts are probably elsewhere anyway, shifting around ideas, figuring out a new set of altered states to explore next time.</p>\n"], ["title", "Roedelius Schneider: Tiden"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18289-roedelius-schneider-tiden/"]]

But, listening to his early Rephlex-released LPs under the µ-Ziq alias, his importance in shaping the style is indisputable. From there his career path has been far from straightforward: by the late 90s he'd made a lateral move, setting up his own label and arguably proving himself a better A&amp;R than he was a producer. Planet Mu presided over several major developments in global electronic music, from millennial breakcore to mid-noughties dubstep and, more recently, footwork.</p> <p>Paradinas’ own production, meanwhile, seemed to falter during the 2000s. 2003’s <i>Bilious Paths</i> was an enjoyable exploration of the sound-and-fury of drill and bass and breakcore, if a little beholden to label successes like Venetian Snares. 2007’s <i>Duntisbourne Abbots Soulmate Devastation Technique</i>, meanwhile, followed the break-up of a long-term relationship, and its suffocatingly maudlin spin on Paradinas’ usual melodic style proved rather difficult to love. Since then we’ve heard little from Paradinas the producer, but 2013 has marked a surprising return to form. First there was Heterotic’s <i>Love &amp; Devotion</i>, an album of euphoric, romantic synth-pop produced in collaboration with Paradinas’ new wife, Lara Rix-Martin. Following that was a µ-Ziq EP, <i>XTEP</i>, which showcased a newly airy sound, contiguous with his past work but also displaying the influence of chillwave, italo disco, piano house, and plenty else besides.</p> <p class=\"p2\">As with both of these records, <i>Chewed Corners</i>, the first µ-Ziq LP in six years, has a certain giddiness to it-- a giddiness, it’s tempting to conclude, born of new love and fresh optimism. Of course, that optimism could be less to do with Paradinas’ personal life than with the state of music: much of this record displays the influence of recent Planet Mu signings, or of broader trends in contemporary electronic music. \"Taikon\" and \"Twangle Melkas\" draw on Kuedo’s Vangelis-via-Southern-hip-hop schtick; \"Tickly Flanks\" owes a debt to the sugar-rush hardcore-footwork hybrids of Machinedrum, though it’s a little torpid in comparison to its forebear. \"Wipe\"'s syncopated rhythms nod to UK funky, while \"Houzz 10\" could be a symptom of the recent house revival-- except Paradinas’ take on the form is particularly dreamy, rolling along on a single blissy break-of-dawn plateau for its duration. </p> <p class=\"p2\">Fortunately, Paradinas just as often succeeds in massaging his inspirations into an idiom entirely his own. There are plenty of highlights here-- heat-warped synth interlude \"Monyth\", the heavy-lidded \"Hug\", \"Mountain Island Boner\", whose portentous piano chords would almost be laughable were they not rather affecting. All of them sound fresh, but are also recognisably µ-Ziq-- unlike the occasional borderline-pastiche footwork remix Paradinas has turned out in recent years. Granted, the weaknesses of past µ-Ziq work live on along with its strengths, and Paradinas’ penchant for overwhelmingly dense arrangements occasionally gets the better of him-- particularly in closer \"Weakling Paradinas\", which aims for euphoric texture-overload but overshoots, resulting in a fatiguing mess. But in <i>Chewed Corners</i> Paradinas has put together an LP brimming with fresh ideas-- which, for an artist entering the third decade of his career, is no mean feat. </p>\n"], ["title", "µ-Ziq: Chewed Corners"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18207--ziq-chewed-corners/"]]

In interviews, they come off as eager, curious, and transparent about their process and their gear, but their music is about as approachable as an Egyptian tomb. On <i>Slow Focus</i>, their first album in four years, Fuck Buttons remain devoted to forbidding, elemental sensations, and their slow-moving pieces inspire the kinds of big feelings-- exhilaration, majesty, awe-- that double as reminders of our smallness. </p> <p>Listening to their progression, from 2008's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11280-street-horrrsing/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Street Horrrsing</i></a> to now, you get the sense of tinkerers building obsessively retooled versions of the monolith from <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, each bigger than the last. (We are the apes in this equation.) They got their start in the noise-rock community, but transcended that niche almost immediately, and their earliest material, some of featuring distorted, screaming vocals, sounds positively quaint in light of what followed.<i> Tarot Sport</i> was so much larger and more ambitious than their debut that it gave them an unlikely career as festival headliners, and a piece of the album (<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11528-surf-solar-7-edit/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Surf Solar\"</a>) snuck its way into Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Olympics. <i>Slow Focus</i> feels like a logical endpoint to their journey: <i>Tarot Sport</i> might have gotten them to the Olympics, but they've never sounded this, well, Olympian before.</p> <p>The difference is apparent from the opening seconds of the nine-minute \"Brainfreeze.\" The massive sounds we hear-- a warped synth figure being pounded into shapes by hammering drums and a pistoning rhythm track-- are lonelier and more remote than anything Fuck Buttons have made before. <i>Tarot Sport</i>, big as it was, gestured vaguely at human bodies, with airy, glittering sounds on \"Surf Solar\" evoking an outdoor festival or a rave. There are no human bodies left on <i>Slow Focus</i>, just open space and hard surfaces, and the sounds resound for miles in all directions.</p> <p>Power and Hung self-produced the record, and judging from the results, they should start producing for other acts as well. Every sound on <i>Slow Focus</i> is smooth, polished, and lovingly molded, like a factory-shaped piece of steel. The album's tone is a curious mix of juiced and muted, like Hung and Power have rewired the maximalism of stadium EDM to arrive at the minimalist emptiness of someone like Detroit's Robert Hood. This is perfectionist's music: <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Dre</a>, who has been holed up for years vacuuming pathogens off of <i>Detox</i> like dead skin cells from a computer keyboard, might be chasing a sound like this-- deep and resonant and beautifully emptied-out.</p> <p>The seven tracks tend to move in simple, navigational arcs: Open widescreen on an empty vista, pull back even further. Midway through \"Brainfreeze\", the synths shift up an octave and widen outward until they slowly swallow the track, a giant space cruiser blotting out the sky. <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15550-fuck-buttons-the-red-wing-edit/\" target=\"_blank\">\"The Red Wing\"</a> begins with percussive pops and adds layers until the percussion all but disappears, a city shrinking to pinprick in a shuttle window. This journey might grow wearying if the textures on the album weren't so fascinating and dimensional; a piece like \"Stalker\" seems to be operating on six different planes at once, and it's a pleasure just to be able to walk through the space.</p> <p>The song titles -- \"Sentients\", \"The Red Wing\", \"Hidden XS\"-- are unusually instructive for Fuck Buttons, who normally make a point of avoiding specific cues for their music. But <i>Slow Focus</i> plays like a utopian nightmare of mechanization-- on \"Year of the Dog,\" György Ligeti strings screech beneath a <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/\" target=\"_blank\">Giorgio Moroder</a> synth, while the first sound on the ten-minute \"Stalker\" is a bland, lasering synth, like a printer whirring away at a thousand-page document. <i>Slow Focus</i> is pointedly pitiless, inexorable: There are no human feelings here, at least of the squishy kind. If you are fascinated by the people around you the same way you are fascinated by protozoa, you might identify uncomfortably with the world <i>Slow Focus</i> depicts. When at the next TED Conference, a clicker-brandishing, headset-wearing speaker argues that harvesting organs from the rest from the human population is the logical way to progress, \"Stalker\" will probably be playing on the slideshow. </p> <p>There has always been menace in Fuck Buttons' music, but it used to exist in balance with lighter, leavening moments, like \"Bright Tomorrow\" or \"The Lisbon Maru\". With the exception of the manic, squeegeeing synths that dance through \"Prince's Prize\", that touch is absent on <i>Slow Focus</i>. It's missed, slightly, but a little humor would have punctured the purity of the world they've built. Power and Hung have made either the year's most introverted party album or the most expansive loner's album; either way, there are few albums this year that offer this much space to get lost in.</p>\n"], ["title", "Fuck Buttons: Slow Focus"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18295-fuck-buttons-slow-focus/"]]

During the last two decades, they’ve released nine albums of headstrong Viking metal, built almost entirely around tales of shared Scandinavian heritage and tunes that either charged like a massive military’s frontline or sailed skyward like a hard-earned victory chant. The best of those records (by mere example, see with <i>Oden on Our Side </i>and <i>Versus the World</i>) have felt both urgent and addictive, combining death metal heft and modern rock-ready hooks to build and brandish verifiable anthems. Indeed, to see Amon Amarth live is to see almost all of an audience throw hands or horns at once, chanting along to stories of wins in war and glory in the afterlife. They are a sort of turbocharged Cliff’s Notes to <i>The Poetic Edda</i> and <i>The Prose Edda</i>, a modern metal band revivifying ancient history with unwavering conviction.</p> <p>There’s little reason to suspect, then, that Amon Amarth will soon run out of stories to sing; their potential pool of subjects is, in essence, a culture’s complete heritage, and they’ve got tales of Oden and Loke to share yet. And there’s always the option of fan-fiction, or creating imagined sagas of pugnacity and defeat from the lore itself. Of late, though, Amon Amarth has started to run out of, if not songs, then novel ways to make their stories really stick within those songs. After an incredible streak of righteous albums, 2011’s <i>Surtur Rising</i> sometimes felt overly stiff and deliberate, as if Amon Amarth were trying to bully past the limits of their own Viking brand. But the new <i>Deceiver of the Gods</i> feels formulaic and tired, as if the long-running quintet has now settled into the complacency and comfort of their reputation-- bad news, of course, for warriors who end songs with shouts of “Now we attack! Ride into fate!” At last, Amon Amarth has made a record that is every bit as rote, uninspired and matter-of-fact as a set of Cliff’s Notes. In the past, they’ve sounded strangely uplifting; this time around, they simply sound persistent.</p> <p>The symptoms start as early as the opening title track, a thrashing sprint that flatlines in the chorus and rebounds a bit in a chant-along bridge but ultimately stumbles into a solo so tepid and predictable that it nearly necessitates skipping right along to the next track, “As Loke Falls”. Amon Amarth at least displays some vivacity <i>there</i>, volleying a riff between drums blasts like a game of pinball. Frontman Johan Hegg sounds convincing here, too, delivering the tale of Ragnarök’s end less like a storyteller than a witness. In fact, Hegg is compelling throughout most of <i>Deceiver of the Gods</i>, and he’s got good material to offer. His account of a brutal murder technique called Blood Eagle makes for fine pulp fiction, while “Shape Shifter” uses the life of the god Loke to discuss betrayal and a necessary balance of light and dark. In fact, reading <i>Deceiver of the Gods</i> is arguably more engaging than listening to most of it. The band behind Hegg seems exhausted or, at the very least, over it. They push ahead with the same up-tempo roil so much that any break at all-- be they the sampled sounds of murder at the start of the gruesome “Blood Eagle” or the psychedelic guitar spirals that introduce closer “Warriors of the North”-- are welcome, overdue diversions. Candlemass’ Messiah Marcolin guests on “Hel”, but Amon Amarth is so unyielding that the best they can do is let him moan in the background like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPuYqL2NB1U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marianne Faithful</a>.</p> <p>It’s not that anyone’s now hoping for Amon Amarth to be metal’s great hybridizers or innovators. Nine albums into a career, no-one expects them to suddenly lace their battle hymns with electronics or noise or to write brilliant black metal bursts or dramatic post-rock crescendos into their records. But Amon Amarth boasts a lot of their own skill, bravery and brilliance within their songs; they are a small army of “endless wrath” and “the walker on the wind” and “fast in thought, quicker tongue.” Here, though, those are only hollow words, self-righteousness from a band bloated on their own lofty reputation and sales history. On <i>Deceiver of the Gods</i>, they are satisfied with plugging 10 new anecdotes into 10 songs they’ve made before and, unfortunately, will most likely make again.</p>\n"], ["title", "Amon Amarth: Deceiver of the Gods"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18222-amon-amarth-deceiver-of-the-gods/"]]

They are not the same game, though. If you read the back cover of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/\">Brian Eno</a>’s 1975 album, <i>Discreet Music</i>, you’ll find a set of diagrams and instructions meant to explain the processes that the producer/composer/guru employed in creating the music. The record, which is often cited as one of the formative works of the ambient genre, contains a series of slowly evolving compositions that rely on slight variations (measure length, echo, equalization) of simple repeating melodic phrases to create a sense of movement amid static components.</p> <p>That same year also saw the debut release by the San Francisco, California-based composer <a href=\"pitchfork.com/artists/31452-iasos/\">Iasos</a>, who would become heavily identified with the then emerging new age genre. Though his compositions are shorter and draw heavy inspiration from spiritual jazz, there are plenty of similarities to Eno’s ambient music, particularly in the gauzy tones and glacial pace. The LP did not come with a score and even if Iasos had wanted to include one, the process might have been tough to explain to an outsider. According to the composer, his music was not written, but communicated to him by a trans-dimensional being called Vista.</p> <p>The purpose of <i>Discreet Music </i>is to fade into the background, to become aural wallpaper that teeters at the edge of comprehension, hence the title. Iasos’ record, <i>Interdimensional Music</i>, requires direct attention. The sounds are not meant to drift on the edge of perception, but expand consciousness-- to transcend Earthly anxiety and envelop the listener in bliss. Like many new age musicians, Iasos was not shy about embracing hokey imagery-- rainbows, crystals, crystalline rainbows-- to get his point accross, and not every track that he cut can transcend the goofiness of his genre. <i>Celestial Soul Portrait</i>, a new compilation assembled by Numero Group, functions as a highlight reel, grabbing some of the sturdiest swatches from the composer’s 30-year-plus career.</p> <p>Born in Greece and raised in upstate New York, by the late 1960s Iasos had moved to California to devote himself to music, eventually settling in Marin County, near San Francisco. He tried playing in a number of rock bands but found his peers a little too Earth-bound in their tastes. After purchasing a four-track recorder, he started experimenting with tape effects, treated sounds and, eventually, synthesizers, which helped him hone the celestial sound he had been reaching for. On “Rainbow Canyon”, which was taken from <i>Interdimensional Music</i>, Iasos improvises on a lap steel guitar, using an echo unit to smear his notes across the stereo field. Were you to dry it out from the effects, his riffing might just sound like a series of Eastern-tinged goofs, but the constantly sliding tones and delay trails give the music an unearthly quality-- soothing, but also seasick. “Cloud Prayer” congeals from a series of drones that the guitarist created using guitar feedback and a wah-wah pedal. It’s an ominous piece, building tension with the muted buzz of low tones.</p> <p>The root of Iasos’ music is in late 1960s composers like Terry Riley, who came from a more formal university background, but who also temporarily embraced the current psychedelic moment, experimenting with drones, tape loops, and the structures of Indian music. The compositions on <i>Celestial Soul Portrait</i> carried those ideas forward, but from a folkier, less academic perspective. Still, the stakes were high for Iasos and his inter-dimensional writing partner. “Imagine creating symphonies by tuning up planets [to] create beautiful chords that echo through the galaxy,” explains Iasos in the compilation's liner notes. “That’s the game Vista is playing.”</p>\n"], ["title", "Iasos: Celestial Soul Portrait"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18238-iasos-celestial-soul-portraits/"]]

To say it's uncompromising would be correct, although somewhat redundant, as he hasn't ever dealt in half measures. But this is not the sound of a sweat-soaked Yow plunging into a crowd and rubbing his blubbery belly all over the faces in the front row; Instead, it's a studio creation, cut somewhere between the art-fun antics of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3563-the-residents/\">the Residents</a>, old horror movie soundtracks, classical leanings, a streak of digital noise, a burst of Spanish guitar, text messages translated by computer software, and a recording of Yow squeezing a cat.</p> <p><i>Tonight You Look Like a Spider</i> is an album that has been 15 years in the making, once destined to be released by <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5804-mike-patton/\">Mike Patton</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.ipecac.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ipecac</a>, but ultimately coming out on the <a href=\"http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joyful Noise</a> label. Naturally, Yow's new home have heralded its release with a <a href=\"http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/how-my-solo-album-happened/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">photo</a> of him with jeans around his ankles, posed in front of a toilet. The picture hovers over a blurb that offers insights such as: \"I named it <i>Tonight You Look Like a Spider</i> after a spider I saw one night.\" Don't look to Yow for any easy explanations for this stuff, but it's better that way, just left hanging out there for people to determine their own interpretation. It's mostly instrumental, alternately brilliant and terrible, sometimes focused, at other times hopelessly rambling. Yow would probably admit as much himself. \"The record is kind of retarded in a lot of ways,\" he said in a recent <a href=\"http://vishkhanna.com/2013/06/25/ep-9-david-yow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">podcast</a> by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vish_Khanna\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vish Khanna</a>.</p> <p>On cursory listens there might not appear to be much that ties this work to Yow's former persona as a drooling, babbling rock beast, but it's pulled from a similar sensibility. He admits to having no formal musical training or even knowing how chords work-- essentially, this is an album that's as psychotic as his live shows with the Jesus Lizard, both of which hinge on the premise that the less you know, the more demented you can get. Part of Yow's success as a vocalist and performer was because there was really no one like him; similarly, this album works best when he's fully committed to making a creation without peer. Its failings come when he edges toward the familiar, at times resembling a dollar store <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker/\">Scott Walker</a>, stuck with MIDI presets in a rotting basement instead of large orchestras in an expansive studio.</p> <p>For someone who worked so well with concision in his other bands, it's a surprise to find out that Yow works best over great lengths of time in his solo guise. The two 10-minute-plus tracks are the best pieces here, one heading off on a million tangents (\"Opening Suite\"), the other closeted in a gradually unfurling drone that resembles a slowed-down air raid siren (\"Visualize This\"). The rest feels like a mixture of Yow amusing himself, sometimes hitting on a strain of inspiration, but just as often tailing off into inconsequential meanderings when the ideas run dry. At its most playful it feels like an army of ringing alarm clocks pounding on your head (\"Uncle\"), or mirrors the kind of pithy spoken word rants <a href=\"http://annmagnuson.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ann Magnuson</a> would undertake in <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bongwater\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bongwater</a> (\"Senator Robinson's Speech\"). Of course, the track that comes closest to beauty, full of dark piano stabs spun through a spooky ambient fog, is called \"Lawrence of a Labia\".</p> <p>Albums recorded over ample stretches of time often don't hold together well, and <i>Tonight</i> is no exception. Sometimes the sounds are horribly dated-- synth-induced slap bass sounds that border on the \"Seinfeld\"-ian, even a hint of<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/8340-al-jourgensen/\"> Al Jourgensen</a>'s industrial emptiness in \"Bleth My Thoul\" (presumably some unspecified private joke Yow is inflicting on his audience). Although one of the strengths of this album is that it's clearly coming straight out of a void, oblivious to anything else around it, there's also a childlike wonder coupled with a decent understanding of the gruesome side of life. Yow's vocal work had that, too. In the times when he wasn't jumping into the audience at Jesus Lizard shows there was something decidedly creepy about him, a feeling of the paunchy uncle with whisky on his breath, cornering you and asking uncomfortable questions. Still, he doesn't quite see it that way. When asked about it on Khanna's podcast, Yow simply responded: \"Am I scary? I’m just ugly.\"</p>\n"], ["title", "David Yow: Tonight You Look Like a Spider"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18209-david-yow-tonight-you-look-like-a-spider/"]]

Mulcahy</i> makes no bones about where it sits musically. Early on, the basic scope is set: Imagine an early 70s never-never world of incipient glam rock and folky pop, UK style. Think of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/\" target=\"_blank\">David Bowie</a> if his glam peak was actually <i>Hunky Dory</i> (“He’s a Magnet” manages the neat trick of suggesting Bowie’s <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/\" target=\"_blank\">Velvet Underground</a> tribute “Queen Bitch” without actually sounding like it) or, even more particularly given Mulcahy’s singing style, if <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/\" target=\"_blank\">T. Rex</a>’s high point was the self-titled album instead of <i>Electric Warrior</i>. Mulcahy’s knowledge of history shows through in the details: many younger musicians miss these particular artists’ smaller moments in favor of the well-worn higher profile ones.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">But while you get a sense of his hard-earned knowledge, Mulcahy doesn't come off as world weary. The previously mentioned “Where’s the Indifference Now” may have a serious subject, but the arrangement is engaging, down to a concluding electric guitar solo, Mulcahy’s singing an energetic rumination that matches the thoughtful lyrics. Similarly, “Poison Candy Heart” may be about a failed relationship, but lines like “I saw you kissing the paperboy” are backed by music that moves sweetly along-- the descending keyboard melody that appears with the first chorus is pure delight, as is a chorused whistling break that mirrors a brief solo introduction to the song. These are representative of <i>Dear Mark J. Mulcahy</i> in general: What drives this record throughout is gentle playfulness.</p> <p>On a lyrical level, Mulcahy offers quick, vivid portraits of people and situations. Early on, the rumbling stomp of “Everybody Hustles Leo” gives a sense of what surprises Mulcahy is capable of: the verses seem to suggest straightforward (if not simply straight) talk about a woman \"who can get milk from a crowbar,\" among other metaphors. But then the chorus makes it seem like it’s a song about a man, or perhaps someone gay, or a trans individual, maybe something else entirely. And it’s all over and done in two and a half minutes, followed by a slower, steadier groove with another intriguing title “She Makes the World Turn Backwards,” featuring a call and response starting with a hoary medical chestnut: “Where does it hurt?” “Everywhere!”</p> <p>That so much on <i>Dear Mark J. Mulcahy</i> should be playful without being straight-up comedy songs or heavy-handed \"jokes\" is one of its best gifts; it’s pretty easy to find yourself starting to lock into turns of phrase rather than letting them pass by in the flow. To pick out three at random: from “Everybody Hustles Leo”: “Who cares, as long as it’s white and you can snort it”;  “He’s a Magnet”: “Lady what’s that book you’re reading/ Oh, the Bible/ That’s so interesting/ They’ve got a word for everything in there”; “Bailing Out on Everything Again”: “Now I smell trouble/ You had better roll down the window.”</p> <p>But if it were all jokes this would be stand-up or spoken-word. That “Let The Fireflies Fly Away” should start with the music settling in while Mulcahy delivers another well-worn joke setup “Waiter, there’s a frog in my...” is one thing. But it’s another when he repeats the phrase only to have a backing chorus add in a “Waiter!” of its own, all with the feeling of one-take ease. (Paul Q. Kolderie’s mixing ear throughout is top notch, everything fitting in just the right place.)</p> <p>The songs on <i>Dear Mark J Mulcahy</i> often have codas that are honest-to-god codas-- different keys, lyrics that tie up or tie together a song, new instruments introduced-- while there are enough notable moments of instrumental bliss, such as the blended guitar parts on “The Rabbit” or the numerous differing drum fills on “My Rose Colored Friend”, that need no explanation when the pleasure one gets from listening to them is so immediate. From start to finish, <i>Dear Mark J. Mulcahy</i> is a treat. In fact, it may be his best yet.</p>\n"], ["title", "Mark Mulcahy: Dear Mark J Mulcahy I Love You"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18251-mark-mulcahy-dear-mark-j-mulcahy-i-love-you/"]]

It’s not even an album: it’s a widely available, 16-year old collection of B-sides from a <i>double album. </i>Granted, the <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins\">Smashing Pumpkins</a>' <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17389-mellon-collie-and-the-infinite-sadness/\"><i>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness </i></a>was more judiciously edited than the title would lead you to believe. It was a 28-song double album all the same, and now <i>Aeroplane </i>nearly quadruples in size with 90 additional tracks on top of its original 33, with a bonus DVD to boot. But while the numbers make <i>The Aeroplane Flies High </i>the most difficult Smashing Pumpkins reissue to <i>endure</i>, it’s actually the easiest to revisit. For most listeners, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16059-gish-deluxe-edition-siamese-dream-deluxe-edition/\"><i>Siamese Dream </i></a>and <i>Mellon Collie </i>are inseparable from the memories of living with those records at a certain age; it’s tough to rehear “Disarm” or “X.Y.U.” without recalling the specific sensory triggers of your parents' house or the details of a particularly shitty day in 10th grade when [INSERT NAME HERE] didn’t reciprocate your crush on them. <i>Aeroplane </i>simply reminds the listener of what it was like to be a Smashing Pumpkins fan when people were expected to pay money for music.</p> <p>It was equally exhilarating and exhausting during the band’s prime. If you caught the videos on MTV and chose to take your Pumpkins fanship to the next level by exploring the deep cuts, the bootlegs, the formative guitar tablature sites, and so forth, you realized that Billy Corgan was every bit as excited about the music of Smashing Pumpkins as his audience. In fact, that probably strikes at the root of everything you’ve come to loathe about Corgan as well: he’s the biggest Smashing Pumpkins fan on earth.</p> <p>So while <i>Aeroplane </i>was always meant as a collector’s item, Corgan made it worth your while. Even if you bought it out of obligation and never even listened to the thing, it was one of the 90s’ most handsome and unique physical packages: five CD singles with their own art design, delivered in a hypno-swirled carrying case. It was a keepsake and a conversation piece, a vinyl era throwback for kids who assumed the CD era would last forever. So even if the songs themselves were dashed off (Corgan claimed “Pennies” took literally minutes to write) or slapped together (the very literal 23-minute guitar collage “Pastichio Medley”), there was nothing half-assed about the actual product.</p> <p>Separating the B-sides onto five separate CDs ensured that the collection was no mere data dump in terms of quality and presentation. If you let your ears go slack a little, every EP retains some important characteristic of its linchpin <i>Mellon Collie </i>single. It’s not an <i>exact</i> fit; with the exception of the country and western curio “Said Sadly”, <i>Bullet With Butterfly Wings </i>is the “covers” EP and the selections brought the new wave genealogy of that song to the fore. The keeper of the bunch is their take on Blondie’s “Dreaming”; not only does it feature a rare lead vocal from bassist D’arcy, but the requisitely light, billowy arrangement distinguishes it from their competent Cars and Alice Cooper karaoke and a fumbled cover of the Cure’s “A Night Like This” where James Iha can’t decide if he wants to perform it as a country, slowcore, or shoegaze song.</p> <p><i>Tonight, Tonight </i>is technically the “ballad” single-- it is the one with the strings and all. Yet, its sumptuous studio arrangement bares no similarity to its attendant outtakes which are mostly solo, acoustic performances from Corgan. Even compared to the spare and wistful lullabies from their previous odds-and-ends collection <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16929-pisces-iscariot/\"><i>Pisces Iscariot </i></a>such as “Whir” and “Obscured”<i>, </i>the songs here sound incomplete rather than realized minimalism. If you’re trying to fashion a four-star Smashing Pumpkins album out of the original B-sides-- and really, that seems like the entire point-- you can skip those two EPs altogether.</p> <p>On the other side, everything on the <i>1979 </i>single warrants inclusion. The most-beloved Smashing Pumpkins single gives these songs a certain halo effect, of course. Beyond that, the lightly carbonated college rock of “The Boy” is easily the best thing James Iha has ever written, while the whispered restraint lent to the could-be power ballad “Believe” puts it as the runner up. More intriguing is how in 20 minutes, the fluorescent and fizzy <i>1979</i> lays out an intriguing “what if?” for the Smashing Pumpkins. While <i>Adore </i>is known as their synth album and a sonic outlier amidst Corgan’s ambitions for Sistine Chapel art-rock, it’s still a 70-minute opus draped in black and smeared with kohl eyeliner. “Ugly” and “Set the Ray to Jerry” are two sides of a coin and together they present a fascinating alternative to <i>Adore</i>: the former a self-hate song driven by palm-muted, bristling guitar and the latter a love song of swirling, phased ambience. Is it possible they could’ve made a minimalist, melody-driven new wave album following in that vein? I have my doubts-- for all his generosity in the realm of B-sides and miscellany, albums are a <i>huge event </i>for Corgan<i> </i>and we’ll never know if “Set the Ray” would’ve included triple-guitar harmonies or if Jimmy Chamberlin’s barnstorming drum rolls would’ve found a way onto “Cherry”.</p> <p>If you want those aspects of Smashing Pumpkins, you can head straight to the <i>Zero </i>EP, which, like the titular single, is the most immediately satisfying of the bunch and the quickest to lose its appeal. “God” rages with such Neanderthal impulses, it’s actually <i>fun; </i>it’s basically “Bullet With Butterfly Wings” if you fast forward straight to the avalanche of its coda. The relatively raw glam-grunge of “Mouths of Babes” and “Marquis in Spades” has an underdog appeal if you somehow thought <i>Mellon Collie </i>was hindered by its concept album ambitions or ever mistook Smashing Pumpkins as being a punk or indie band at some point; but as far as riffs or melodies or dynamics go, they’re all second-tier Corgan compositions.</p> <p>That leaves us with <i>Thirty-Three</i>, the oft-forgotten single from<i> Mellon Collie </i>and the least typical of the lot. The rest of the EP follows suit, as it bears the collection’s most risky and disparate offerings; you  get the prettiest cover (“My Blue Heaven”) and the sludgiest, slowest guitar workout (“The Aeroplane Flies High (Turns Left Looks Right)”). The electro-spazz of “Transformer” segues into Iha’s ornate, porcelain art-pop offering “The Bells”. And it’s all preceded by the showstopping closer on your hypothetical <i>Aeroplane </i>single-CD; containing one of Corgan’s most sweet and yearning vocal performances as well as guitar solo from his father, “The Last Song” feels too crucial to be ignored and too personal to make it onto an album with <i>Mellon Collie’s </i>overt commercial ambitions.</p> <p>And those are all things you can surmise from buying the original version of <i>Aeroplane Flies High</i>; the tracks have been remastered here, though liars and professional audio engineers are the only people who will claim to notice the effect. Like every Pumpkins reissue, <i>Aeroplane </i>is stocked with extras; the difference here is that they’re jammed onto each single seemingly at random, rather than separated into bonus discs. As a result, the tasteful and accessible arrangement of the original is compromised, negating one of its best qualities. For example, why are <i>15 </i>tracks of instrumental jamming slapped onto <i>Bullet With Butterfly Wings</i>? And these aren’t snippets either, some go on for five minutes, and mostly prove that while Smashing Pumpkins <i>songs </i>are pantheon material, Smashing Pumpkins <i>riffs </i>are fairly easy to come by. As works in progress, they’re nothing particularly special; it’d be more interesting if Corgan granted a Creative Commons License as part of the purchase price and allowed fans to use his scraps to come up with their best Smashing Pumpkins imitation.</p> <p>Otherwise, do we need the Smashing Pumpkins’ July 1995 performance at Chicago’s Double Door <i>and </i>their rehearsal? The DD rehearsal is spirited and ragged, notable for Corgan cracking up during “By Starlight” of all things and reconfiguring the lyrics of “God”. As far as the actual performance, you almost wish Corgan would <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDndsvjyIG4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">get all Patton Oswalt on the dude who’s yelling</a> in the middle of “Stumbleine”. Forget all of those-- head straight to “Special Winner’s Song”, which is five minutes of interactive crowd participation and <i>an improvised rap </i>by James Iha who is presumably drunk as shit. Hearing him yell, “D’arcy Wretzky on the motherfucking bass!” makes the whole endeavor somehow worth it because it’s one of the few times you might imagine the Smashing Pumpkins being four people who enjoyed each other’s company.</p> <p>With all that said, <i>Aeroplane </i>gives you insight to what a tremendous strain it must’ve been to be a member of the Smashing Pumpkins-- if listening to everything on <i>Aeroplane Flies High </i>seems taxing, imagine playing it. And imagine that what ended up on this still somehow isn’t the sum total of their recorded output at the time. On a basic level, the supersizing of <i>Aeroplane </i>magnifies what it was back in 1996, a point where Corgan’s giving nature felt more like neediness, where the generosity started to lose its altruism and became an oppressive act. The deluxe reissuing of Smashing Pumpkins’ heyday has resulted in upwards of 200 bonus tracks and the ones on <i>Aeroplane </i>are almost entirely inessential. You learn from the eight-track demo of “Zero” that it needs vocals and it needs Jimmy Chamberlain. You learn from the live version that it <i>doesn’t </i>need 50% more whammy pedal soloing. If it’s easy to revisit <i>Aeroplane</i> without getting emotionally attached, it’s harder to talk about for the same reason. But it gets us one step closer to reevaluating <i>Adore, </i>the first Pumpkins record that underperformed commercially and critically, whose legacy is still somewhat in flux. And that’s a worthy cause even if <i>Aeroplane </i>couldn’t possibly justify its price tag.</p>\n"], ["title", "The Smashing Pumpkins: The Aeroplane Flies High"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18259-the-smashing-pumpkins-the-aeroplane-flies-high/"]]

Under this lineup, they released a series of splits and one full-length, 2009's <i>Deconstruct</i>. They've since abandoned the dualing genders angle; Kracheni was replaced by Rahi Geramifar, currently of Houston's War Master and formerly of grindcore insurgents Insect Warfare. Geramifar also guested on <i>Deconstruct</i>, credited as “Gargling Urine”; his guttural vocals live to that moniker in his other bands, but they were somewhat redundant placed alongside Hughes.</p> <p>Now, almost a decade after forming, Hatred Surge are a trio, rounded out by long-standing members Chris Ulsh (also of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/31190-power-trip/\" target=\"_blank\">Power Trip</a>, Mammoth Grinder, and the Impalers) on guitar and drummer Mike Sharp (who's played in the Impalers as well, in addition to Sungod and a former stint in Trap Them), with Hughes taking over all vocal duties.<i> Human Overdose</i>, released during the recent Chaos in Tejas festival in Austin, is their first record as a three-piece, and it's their burliest, most focused yet.</p> <p>Ulsh's guitar work in Mammoth Grinder, which combines death metal, Discharge, and the “power groove” sound pioneered by Pantera, creep into <i>Overdose</i>, especially in the longer songs. Those seeds were sown when the Hatred Surge did a split with Mammoth Grinder-- Hughes and Ulsh essentially doing a split with themselves-- in 2011, and now they've sprouted fatally poisonous berries. Nowhere is this more apparent than in “Psychonaut”, which could easily be a Mammoth Grinder song if it weren't for Hughes' deep growl. A galloping intro breaks way into a Swedeath catharsis. The intro riff on “God Complex” brings to mind a more fluid, less mechanical Prong, and “Delta Nine” jerky swings are among the most “power groovy” riffs on the record. In fact, the swifter songs on this album are like Pantera's “Slaughtered” raised on punk, right down to the lyrics, exploring the link between social corruption and the breakdown of one's inner will.</p> <p>Travis Bonner's production lends <i>Overdose</i> a stronger death metal feel than their previous work, emphasizing downtuned crunch and smearing it just enough without turning the album into incoherent “bestial” beige. With the album's focus on concise, concentrated explosions, the ambient intro “Figurehead” feels like a blockade (not endless, thankfully) to the emotional release of “Psychonaut”. Those electronics appear again at the very end of the title track, also the record's closing number, in a shorter, more fitting fashion. <i>Overdose</i>'s consistent quality renders this less of a gaping flesh wound and more of an annoying scab, really.</p> <p>Hatred Surge could be the spiritual successor of Iron Age, another Austin band Hughes took part in. Iron Age started as another hardcore band with some metal influences, but by 2009's <i>The Sleeping Eye,</i> they morphed into a beast with crossover's ferocity and Manilla Road's sense of grandeur. It's useless to ask “what could have been,” especially in a genre with vocal contingents of fans who inquire about Cliff Burton and Lars Ulrich switching spots on the bus, but Iron Age were definitely onto something a lot of their revivalist peers were not, save for Power Trip. Hatred Surge, likewise, by incorporating more metal into their sound, have both matured and grown even heavier than before.</p>\n"], ["title", "Hatred Surge: Human Overdose"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18278-hatred-surge-human-overdose/"]]

But on <i>About Farewell, </i>her fourth record, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/6327-alela-diane/\" target=\"_blank\">Alela Diane</a> comes by her romantic devastation honestly. The Portland-based folkie was last heard on 2011’s excellent <i>Alela Diane &amp; Wild Divine</i>, where she was backed by a crack band equally conversant in soul, country, and 1970s SoCal soft-rock. Diane’s musical co-pilot was guitarist Tom Bevitori, also her husband at the time. Sadly, the marriage ended between <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15276-alela-diane-wild-divine/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Alela Diane &amp; Wild Divine </i></a>and <i>About Farewell, </i>prompting a return to the stark guitar-and-voice arrangements of Diane’s early work on a collection of songs that ache with the specificity of poetic reportage on the last flickers of a doomed relationship.</p> <p><i>About Farewell </i>is a backward-looking record for Diane, musically and lyrically, but it’s also a reboot of sorts. Superficially it resembles her stunning 2004 debut, <i>The Pirate’s Gospel</i>, except it sounds more grown-up. The understated sumptuousness of <i>Alela Diane &amp; Wild Divine<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15276-alela-diane-wild-divine/\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></i>is mostly gone (and keenly missed), though Diane finds way to work that record’s expansiveness into the cozier confines of <i>About Farewell. </i>On the foreboding <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15126-alela-diane-the-way-we-fall/\" target=\"_blank\">“The Way We Fall”</a>, which sketches an evocative setting-- it’s Indian summer, there are wildfires burning, and a whiskey bottle is being passed around-- that feels like a bittersweet memory, muted horns and a muffled drum track soften the barbed-wire tentacles of Diane’s skeletal guitar and ghostly backing vocals. On “Nothing I Can Do”, the frustration expressed so beautifully in the chorus (“Honey there is nothing I can do/ to save you from yourself”) turns playful with the introduction of gently pirouetting piano ringlets.</p> <p>The star of the show, as always on Alela Diane records, is Diane’s voice. Nimble and graceful like a jazz singer, sad and knowing like a blues crooner, but always restrained like a bedroom-pop auteur speaking softly into a four-track, Diane delivers her detached observations on the end of her marriage with stinging intimacy. “Before the Leaving” is a melancholic travelogue from the perspective of two traveling musicians who are slowly drifting apart. “Side by side we pass through towns/ that we’ll never see/ and it’s here I will wait out the storm,” she sings, drawing out that last part a few extra painful beats. The album’s saddest track-- the competition on<i> About Farewell </i> is fierce for the distinction-- is “Hazel Street”, where Diane suggests that the coupling was troubled from the beginning. (“I woke up drunk on that basement floor/and then you asked how I would read the score/ If you asked me to marry you.”) Diane is similarly fatalistic on the lilting “I Thought I Knew”, when she sighs, “I’d only just arrived/ when I foresaw the end.”</p> <p>A record seemingly composed over the course of many sleepless nights and hungover mornings, <i>About Farewell </i>is yet another addition to the canon of brokenhearted sadsack singer-songwriter records. Surely there will be another artist attempting to make their own <i>Blood on the Tracks </i>or <i>Blue </i>very soon. Alela Diane hasn’t upended the form, but that probably wasn’t her intent. What she needed was a port in a storm, and <i>About Farewell </i>is a very sturdy bulwark.</p>\n"], ["title", "Alela Diane: About Farewell"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18265-alela-diane-about-farewell/"]]

Ty Dolla $ign’s talents recently landed him a deal with Atlantic Records via Wiz Khalifa’s Taylor Gang imprint, and he celebrated the occasion this month with the release of <i>Beach House 2</i>. The sequel follows on the lead of the original, but where <i>Beach House </i>presented a summation of the artist’s varying talents, <i>Beach House 2</i> feels like a dry run for the majors, weighted down by a glut of largely ineffectual guest raps, songs recycled from other artists’ mixtapes and remixes of songs that didn’t really need fixing.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Dolla $ign’s arrangements are lush and intriguing on songs like “I Bet”, which matches oceanic synths to subterranean bass in the verses before a wash of keys overtake the mix at every chorus. All of the outside producers he calls on follow his lead by striking a precarious balance between house music and Southern hip-hop, mostly to dazzling results. But his impish lyricism wages a continual warfare with the sweetness of the music, and it occasionally makes for rough listening. You can snicker at darts like “I took his main bitch away like King Koopa” on “Creez”, but you have to sneak past a minefield of “These hoes be playing games for nothing” and “These bitches ain’t shit” to get there. It gets ugly on “Bitches Ain’t Shit”, where Ty$ graces a spectral, druggy production with a yarn about stealing a guy’s girlfriend containing a bridge where he tells the girl “Your nigga laid up in the hospital, and you still think of me/ Man, I swear to God I’d kill your fucking ass if you did that shit to me”. It illuminates the extent to which the mawkish depravity of Ty’s songs feels like an end in itself. R&amp;B knows no shortage of dirtbag auteurs, but where <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2385-r-kelly/\" target=\"_blank\">R.

Those records got retro-soul revivalist tags stapled on to them, thanks to a hip-hop fiend's sense of vintage soul that drew heavily off Stax/Motown goodwill vibes. But the real scope of his musical influences jump out on the 2011 covers EP, <i>Impressions</i>, where his classic R&amp;B leanings ran the gamut from the well-loved Isleys to the obscure Festivals. He also made a point of taking on some of his blue-eyed soul contemporaries-- artists like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/909-chromeo/\" target=\"_blank\">Chromeo</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/574-jon-brion/\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Brion</a>, who work adjacent to R&amp;B and funk without necessarily binding themselves to it. If integrating those attributes meant Hawthorne took on multiple pop lineages at once in order to establish a unique identity of his own, it's served him well so far.</p> <p>As he keeps moving forward and adds on new dimensions to his repertoire, Hawthorne's new album, <i>Where Does This Door Go</i>, gives him a lot of self-imposed leeway. Here he cedes his usual production duties to an all-star cast. There's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/910-cee-lo-green/\" target=\"_blank\">Cee-Lo</a> collaborator and Plantlife funkateer Jack Splash, Oak of pop-rap/R&amp;B production superteam Pop &amp; Oak, producer-to-the-stars Greg Wells and-- most prominent of all-- Pharrell Williams, who shares Hawthorne's eccentric depth and enthusiasm for modernized, chronology-twisting sounds. That Hawthorne's wrangled this crew into a consistently engaged sound is to his credit, where his impact is tangible enough that the committee effect takes a backseat.</p> <p>Hawthorne deliberately shaking his throwback rep is probably the best thing you could expect from <i>Where Does This Door Go</i>: the songs sound clean and of the now, aided by people who successfully mine the last couple generations' best pop ideas. That this music sounds sly without actually feeling like a joke is impressive-- there's too much practiced musicianship in songs like the breezy quiet storm<i>-</i>via-<i>Private Eyes </i>“Backseat Lover” or the <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3021-nerd/\" target=\"_blank\">N.E.R.D.</a><i>-</i>does<i>-Aja </i>bounce of “Reach Out Richard\". This wouldn't be the first review comparing Hawthorne's sensibility to '77 Steely Dan or '81 Hall &amp; Oates, but those admittedly fitting touchstones mean that even through production proxies, he's springboarding off of artists who were already looking at the horizon and the rearview at the same time. Retro isn't the same thing as timeless, and this album trades up in taking that second route.</p> <p>It helps that Hawthorne's improved noticeably as a singer. Once a tolerably flat if charismatic vocalist, he's expanded his range and his confidence. His falsetto's finally started to resonate as charmingly vulnerable instead of just withdrawn, he's gotten better at sounding eccentric without forcing it (dig the way he casually rolls off the oddball pronunciation of “Chris-ti-an-Di-or” on “Wine Glass Woman”), and his penchant for interjecting f-bombs in otherwise sweetly sung lyrics comes across more frankly sincere than gratuitously snotty. Those lyrics are more straightforward than ever: Like a lot of the music he's called back to over the years, it's stuff that lives and dies on its delivery. He can fit in some neat turns of phrase; “She walks into a room and all the lights flicker violently” is a vivid way to start “The Innocent”. But just as many songs attempt to build a lot out of a little, like the yearbook-quote simplicity of teenage weekend bender anthem “The Stars Are Ours” (“Well we're breakin' all the rules/ 'cause they're getting in the way/ And we'll never be as young as we are today”) or the bad-sex-as-tired-machinery conceit of “Robot Love\". Still, it never gets cringingly obvious enough to feel like the performance can't redeem the ordinary-at-worst lyrics.</p> <p><i>Where Does This Door Go </i>is a record that's equally focused on delivering mildly self-effacing party jams and empathetic moments of connection. Women are both predatory seductresses to be avoided (“The Innocent”) and sympathetic done-wrong figures to identify with (the <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/\" target=\"_blank\">Jessie Ware</a>-featuring “Her Favorite Song”). Moments of post-hedonistic defensiveness (“Crime,” which <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/\" target=\"_blank\">Kendrick Lamar</a> reliably owns) are followed by an apologetic yet reassuring monologue to his father (“Reach Out Richard”). Inconsistency or complexity? Depends on how much you believe in this music as sincere self-expression versus its status as smartly crafted, artist-as-listener-proxy pop. Three albums in to a late-blooming career, it's getting easier and easier to picture Hawthorne, a DJ-turned-singer and fan-turned-musician, pulling off both.</p>\n"], ["title", "Mayer Hawthorne: Where Does This Door Go"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18257-mayer-hawthorne-where-does-this-door-go/"]]

It's to <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/302-william-basinski/\">William Basinski</a>'s credit that he hasn't let the weight of his most lauded piece, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/577-the-disintegration-loops-i-iv/\"><i>The Disintegration Loops</i></a>, overwhelm him. He still appears proud of that album, releasing an expanded <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17064-the-disintegration-loops/\">box-set</a> edition last year, bolstering its reputation instead of shirking from it. It's essentially become a living, breathing thing. Letting <i>The Disintegration Loops</i> take a back seat never felt like much of an option for Basinski anyway. A large part of that album's narrative was spun out of his real-world struggles with his art, triggered by the financial woes he was undergoing prior to its release. The rush of people toward it must have provoked a strong sense of freedom and validation-- not easy emotions to forget, and ones that were presumably not taken for granted by someone in Basinski's circumstance.</p> <p>His return to <i>The Disintegration Loops</i> also tied into Basinski's ever evolving relationship with his own past, as witnessed by the frequent reworkings of his older material. <i>Nocturnes</i> is his first new solo recording in four years, but the 40-minute-long title track is a return to a tape and prepared piano piece recorded in his San Francisco period circa 1979-80. The second of the two tracks dates back to 2009, parts of which featured in Robert Wilson's opera, <i>The Life and Death of Marina Abramović</i>. Things don't get left behind in Basinski's world, they carry on mutating as the years pass, provoking questions about where things begin and end. \"I have a weird way of living in time,\" he said in an <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8983-william-basinski/\">Update</a> interview in 2012. \"I just try to stay in the eternal present.\"</p> <p>Both <i>Nocturnes</i> tracks are wrinkle-free. Immaculate, even. There's nothing that suggests an era in which they might have been recorded. No trace of a dusty old reel-to-reel tape machine, no dated recording techniques. Basinski's relationship to time is key, especially on \"Nocturnes\", where it's easy to lose track of how long its slow-moving loops have been gently rotating around one another. Somehow, Basinski has mastered how to keep material like this interesting, slowly fading in changes, just doing enough to make it immersive. This isn't exactly the \"eternal present\" he refers to-- instead, it feels more like an attempt to manipulate time, to see how malleable its boundaries can be. Seconds pass like weeks, minutes turn into seconds. Often it's hard to tell whether you're at the end or in the middle. Ultimately, those distinctions don't really matter.</p> <p>The only part of the overall work that takes you out of the moment is in the transition from one track to the other. Initially, the switch is jarring, resembling an alarm clock sounding at a particular inopportune moment in a dream. \"Nocturnes\" is all muddy, languid movement; \"The Trail of Tears\" has a coarser, more agile feel. The latter is a lesser work, making an awkward fit in an album that may have benefitted from containing just one track. \"Nocturnes\" siphons its beauty from the slow-release journey that Basinski instills in it. By contrast, \"The Trail of Tears\" starts by resembling a paint-cracked old rocking chair creaking into infinity, only to drift into a wash of ambient mush. It tilts toward total escapism, taking on a dream-like state. But Basinski's best work isn’t positioned there; he's better when fusing the otherworldly with the real. On \"Nocturnes\", abstract thoughts become one with the music, forming a place so tangible you can almost reach out and touch it.</p>\n"], ["title", "William Basinski: Nocturnes"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18282-william-basinski-nocturnes/"]]

Be it in Alabama or Ohio, the covers for these releases were usually interchangeable: the sun setting over a landscape, waves breaking against the rocks, and-- most fitting for the implicit metaphor of New Testament enlightenment conquering darkness-- sunbeams lancing through a cloud.</p> <p>In the opening notes for Numero Group’s third compilation of gospel music, subtitled <i>Aprocryphal Hymns</i>, they explain that such pastoral landscapes were interchangeable when it came to ordering your very own record sleeves, citing the Century Records Custom Recording Service of Saugus, Calif., in the 1960s and 70s. Gospel acts ranging from the Sensational Friendly Four of Selma, Ala., to the Supreme Jubilees chose their sleeve art dependent on what image seemed most inspirational. Per the Jubilees’ Leonard Sanders: \"When I saw that photo of the sun setting into the ocean, it seemed to express everything we were trying to say.” The Traveling Souls, Song Birds of the South, and Flying Eagle Gospel Singers thought it spoke for them, too.</p> <p>From such visual clichés come the most intimate of expressions, though, as <i>Aprocryphal Hymns</i> makes clear. Covering the 1960s through the late 70s, <i>Aprocryphal Hymns</i> documents a time of flux for gospel music. Whereas the previous generation caned “Amazing Grace”, soon pop music such as Curtis Mayfield’s “People Get Ready” began to be refigured as praiseworthy fare. Harmonies here draw as much from Philly Soul as they do from Claude Jeter. And with the rise of home studios, what this set compiles is a more personal relationship with God established via magnetic tape.</p> <p>The hi-hats distort on Robert Vanderbilt &amp; the Foundation of Souls’ “A Message Especially From God”, but its message comes through from syrup-slow flanged guitar and honeyed harmonies. Another deliriously unhurried guitar solo and some fine falsetto praise from the Spiritual Harmonizers puts “God’s Love” somewhere between Mayfield and the Congos. Who knew God was such a 'head for psychedelic music? Elsewhere on this 20-track compilation, the run from Shelton Kilby’s “Poor Wayfaring Stranger” through Jonah Thompson’s wistful “Get Involved” onto the Supreme Jubilees’ “It’ll All Be Over”, is simply sublime. On the latter, end days are rendered into R&amp;B as bittersweet as David Toop’s <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/Various-Sugar-And-Poison/release/528218\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Sugar &amp; Poison</i></a> set.</p> <p>There are more than a few attempts at the Delfonics’ “La-La (Means I Love You)” beat, while on Dwain Vinyard’s “Searching for the Truth” the break verges on turning into “Les Fleurs”, but for the most part, the rhythms here involve man imitating machine. Snare patterns rarely budge beyond the pitter-patter of early rhythm acers like Sly Stone and Shuggie Otis. Only Otis G. Johnson’s skeletal-soul perambulation of “Walk With Jesus” uses an actual drum machine though, one from a retrofitted Hammond B-3, with Johnson’s Ford Motor Plant skills used to tweak the machine’s inner rhythms. And much like the way in which Sly Stone used such a metronome on 1971’s <i>There’s a Riot Goin’ On</i>, the pulse here acts as a beacon through the haze.</p>\n"], ["title", "Various Artists: Good God!

First there was <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/9916-cajun-dance-party/\">Cajun Dance Party</a>, then there was Yuck, then there was <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29546-oupa\">Oupa</a>, and now here’s Hebronix-- in the past five years, Blumberg's released widely available records with four different, awkwardly named bands. That takes a lot of commitment and an utter lack of it as well. But while the rambling and roomy songs on <i>Unreal </i>offer Blumberg all the space he wants, it often turns out to be far more than he needs.</p> <p>In addition to the opening track on <i>Yuck, Unreal </i>recasts that album’s closer, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12058-rubber/\">“Rubber”</a>, in a new light; a seven-minute slowcore dirge, “Rubber” smoldered with the speed and intensity of a tire fire. It was an outlier on <i>Yuck </i>and a template here. There are six songs on <i>Unreal </i>and “Rubber” would be the fifth-longest. The initial problem is how this framework can make Blumberg sound more stubborn than ambitious. Opener “Unliving” has some intriguing passages: it begins as a downer solo performance that immediately posits <i>Unreal </i>as a confessional, eventually evolving into a slowly levitating chorus of “ahs.” But they’re splayed about haphazardly and separated by extended subdivisions of laggard drumming and aimless guitar interplay-- it feels like Blumberg started with the goal of making a daunting, 10-minute opener and just worked towards that end. This quality is also shared by its uncompromising and uneventful bookend, “The Plan” which personifies the insularity of its hook (“I’ve got some things to do/ Some private things to do”). In addition to the title of that track, Blumberg’s tastes in frazzled, fuzz-flecked guitar tones will allow comparisons to <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill\">Built to Spill</a>, another band that’s never shied away from Crazy Horse soloing and marathon track lengths. But where even Doug Martsch’s most labyrinthine studio constructions have a plan, Hebronix can sound fueled by the belief that an eight minute song necessarily grants you twice the ragged glory of one that’s four minutes. </p> <p>As with most indie artists in the lineage of Neil Young, Blumberg’s proclivity for jangly acoustic/electric jamming can ultimately reveal itself as charming rather than curmudgeonly. <i>Unreal </i>hits a stride during its midsection where “Wild Whim” and the title track strike the right balance of being unforced but not <i>too </i>effortless. They’re every bit as shambling as “Unliving” or “The Plan”, but aren’t meant to convey the idea of Blumberg as a “challenging” artist. “Wild Whim” details a “wild day of sin” but also a solitary one (“There you are on top of him/ Creating situations I’ve never been in”) over an endlessly repeating chord progression, while “Unreal” simply intones “I feel unreal” over and over again until this insouciant state becomes some kind of a stoned reality, a day without clocks where you wake up and just keep going until you shut down. <i>Unreal </i>is a pretty explicit hangover/breakup record, yet “Wild Whim” in particular feels like it’s mining the positive side of those situations, a freedom you get from a sudden a lack of obligation, where you counter the hardships of the previous day by taking back the power and wasting the current one.</p> <p>It’s easy to draw that conclusion based on the fissuring of Yuck as well as the ramshackle production of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3610-royal-trux\">Royal Trux</a>’s Neil Hagerty. A benefit of working with Hagerty is that you appear a little seedier by association and <i>Unreal </i>does come off as decidedly less wholesome than any of Blumberg’s previous work. There was a sweetness and naivety to the heartbreak detailed on <i>Yuck’s </i>“Shook Down” and “Sunday”<i>, </i>whereas here, “Viral” and “Wild Whim” both underline his loneliness with lyrics that make big assumptions about the sex his ex is having elsewhere. Likewise, the rare rhythmic foible or piped-in electronic noise is meant to sound queasy rather than quirky. But you mostly sense Blumberg’s decidedly depressive state in the manner in which <i>Unreal </i>takes its sweet time doing everything. After two minutes of whooshing cello, feedback, and electric piano, “Viral” blooms into <i>Unreal</i>’s most immediately fetching chorus. In fact, it might be the <i>only </i>one. Listening to the sweet co-ed harmonies, the concise and utilitarian lyrics, it stands to reason that Blumberg might feel a little guilty about “Viral”; despite all of his attempts to contort and distend “Viral” during its relatively brief five minutes, you can’t shake how reminiscent it is of Yuck.</p> <p>It’s an encapsulation of the messy separations that define <i>Unreal. </i>The lyrics talk about disintegrated relationships in the past tense, while the music suggests that while Blumberg has left Yuck, he hasn’t quite <i>quit </i>his last and most successful guise. Blumberg is a capable, if not particularly distinguished guitarist. He is also a songwriter with an unusual gift for sticky, familiar hooks and the issue here is that <i>Unreal </i>puts far more emphasis on the former. On <i>Unreal, </i>Blumberg still can’t get away from himself, he’s just figuring out ways to accept it. </p>\n"], ["title", "Hebronix: Unreal"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18292-hebronix-unreal/"]]

It’s a snapshot of a moment when seemingly every emergent indie act was trying to elbow their way into Animal Collective's campfire circle by reverbing their voices into oblivion, duct-taping their guitar pedals down to achieve infinite delay, and locking their rhythms into an epileptic stutter. But as prevalent as that messthetic was, it’s one that has served as a springboard into myriad directions: Doldrums’ recent <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17646-doldrums-lesser-evil/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Lesser Evil</i></a> pumped it up to super-club size; Braids’ upcoming <i>Flourish // Perish</i> chisels it into minimalist electro-prog.

(When he repeats, ad infinitum, “They tell me I make you smile/ one time a week,” it’s with the cool confidence of a guy who presumes that, even with an 86% strike-out rate, he’s still got a crack at the courtship.)</p> <p>If Gauntlet Hair’s debut sounded like it was recorded at the bottom of a well, “Human Nature” is the geyser that shoots <i>Still</i> above-ground into the great wide open. And, more often than not, Gauntlet Hair successfully answer the challenge of pushing themselves to both more populist and aggressive extremes: “Heave” and “Waste Your Art” are batcave-rockin’ fist-pumpers packed with massive, larynx-shredding choruses that imagine Kurt Cobain dressed up in PVC; “Falling Out” is a robo-rockabilly rave-up that feels like a 21st-century answer to Love &amp; Rockets’ “<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQkJrCgl0UA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yin and Yang The Flowerpot Man</a>.” The duo excel at moodier, downtempo material, too: the insidious “Bad Apple” is a smooth mid-80s MOR ballad by way of Wax Trax, and the dubbed-out “G.I.D.” boasts the album’s most sublime sonic flourish, when the song’s elating chorus hook is reprised as a mutant, slowed-down synth line that sounds like a symphony melting into the floor.</p> <p>It's too bad the duo can’t sustain that sort of boldness over <i>Stills</i>’ entirety, even with a total runtime of just 31 minutes. This is ultimately a transitory record, its gate-crashing momentum tempered by songs that feel like holdovers from Gauntlet Hair’s more whimsical debut. With <i>Stills</i>’ crisper production cleaning up the band’s formative psych-pop splatter, the album’s more sanguine tracks, like the bass-slapping tropical-funk of “Simple” and Panda Bear-hugging “New To It”, come off as plodding and nondescript; what at first seems like an audacious, game-changing record for the band ends up feeling patchy and indecisive. <i>Stills</i>’ most bracing moments show that Rauworth and Nice have their eyes on the prize-- and the stadium back rows-- but their grand visions occassionally get obscured here by navel-gazing regressions. They’ve laid down the gauntlet; they just have to keep trimming the hair.</p>\n"], ["title", "Gauntlet Hair: Stills"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18271-gauntlet-hair-stills/"]]

But fast-forward to 2013 and things look almost entirely different: Baatin and Dilla having passed on in the past half-decade, the core unit carrying on the legacy is T3 (the only founding member remaining), Illa J, and Young RJ.</p> <p>With just a single original member, it seems wrong call this project Slum Village. Young RJ handled all the production here but none of his beats bring to mind this outfit’s classic material, though a few channel imitation-worthy rap songs from years past: “Scared Money” is heavily percussive like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/960-clipse/\" target=\"_blank\">Clipse</a>’s “Grindin’”, “Summer Breeze” is like a modest take on <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3002-nas/\" target=\"_blank\">Nas</a>’ “Summer on Smash”, and “The Line” channels <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/7749-big-boi/\" target=\"_blank\">Big Boi</a>’s booming bro-down “Follow Us”. But when RJ tries to do something new and inventive behind the boards, he doesn't follow through and winds up with something like the minute-long scratch solo that closes “Rock Rock”. Still, RJ produced most of <i>Villa Manifesto</i>, a solid outing for Slum Village in every respect, so it’s unclear why these beats fall so flat compared to the ones he was making just a few years ago.</p> <p>The current Slum Village lineup has a lot of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/15491-black-star/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Star</a> in it. That’s not to say SV are trying to define the underground-rap of today like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2838-mos-def/\" target=\"_blank\">Mos Def</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2348-talib-kweli/\" target=\"_blank\">Talib Kweli</a> did 15 years ago, but the lineage can be heard in these MCs’ interplay, which is one of the few things that they do well together. Unfortunately, with the absence of former Villager Elzhi, who with his 2011 <i>Illmatic </i>tribute proved himself to be the most talented writer ever to hold a full-time position in this group, Slum Village has little to say lyrically. They most often rap about rapping, but when they switch things up, as on the testosterone-infused “Summer Breeze”, the results can be disastrous: “Chest 36C, hips 42/ Can’t blame me for the freaky things I’ll do to you/ Your body’s my Viagara.”</p> <p>At least that line is delivered with some excitement. Too much else feels like coasting. There’s an unfortunately telling declaration on track eight, “Hustle”: “We don’t talk much, we let our history define us.” Such a policy of terseness was the basis of at least <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly3DZ9QU6hs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">one hit rap song in 2012</a>; here, it’s ironic given that these three, as a unit, still have plenty to prove.</p>\n"], ["title", "Slum Village: Evolution"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18227-slum-village-evolution/"]]

In '77, the comedian (or, as he preferred, \"song-and-dance man\") was 28 years old, and his bits were marked by wide-eyed innocence. At that point, it often seemed like his characters were pre-pubescent or eerily unaware of the adult world; in fact, much of his material at the time was culled from previous stints entertaining childrens' birthday parties as a teenager or hosting a kids' show, \"Uncle Andy's Funhouse,\" in college. For Kaufman, retaining this child-like perspective was essential-- he even took up Transcendental Meditation in an attempt to hold onto this aura as he entered his twenties-- and it helped to inspire a similar feeling in his audience, to make them think back to a time before bills and heartbreak and death. A <a href=\"http://youtu.be/CjNlT3CL6yE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">TV special he taped in the summer of 1977</a> epitomized this era as it featured his hopelessly naive Foreign Man character, a sincere interview with Kaufman's childhood idol Howdy Doody, and a step-by-step tutorial on how to make chocolate milk. The showcase ended with a sing-along to a song called <a href=\"http://youtu.be/41n3mwCcZQ4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"This Friendly World\"</a>.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Due to its unabashedly offbeat nature (is he kidding? is he serious? what <i>is</i> he?) that special was shelved and would not air until two years later, after Kaufman had gained more fame with his role on <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077089/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Taxi\"</a>. But by then, in the summer of '79, the performer had, as one TV critic put it, \"turned.\" He had started wrestling women onstage because he loved wrestling and its ridiculous theater. He also found the activity quite arousing and, according to Bill Zehme's definitive biography <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Lost-Funhouse-Life-Mind-Kaufman/dp/0385333722\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Lost in the Funhouse</i></a>, it was a good way for Kaufman to break the ice with girls he wanted to have sex with after the show. Not very innocent. He also invented a new character, <a href=\"http://youtu.be/8zpNIomYAkE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tony Clifton</a>, who was the exact opposite of his lovable <a href=\"http://youtu.be/pjYDSi1ZUcY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Foreign Man</a>-- a Vegas-style lout in a bad toupee, tumbling gut, and hideous moustache. Clifton was pure id, a reaction against Kaufman's kid-friendly former self. Looking back, that period between '77 and '79 was especially pivotal for Kaufman-- it's also the timeframe when he taped 82 hours of audio from his everyday life onto his newly purchased microcassette recorder. A keenly edited version of those tapes make up the 48 minutes of <i>Andy and His Grandmother</i>, a comedy album that is, fittingly, unlike any other.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The inspiration behind Kaufman's home recordings may be a man that his confidant and co-conspirator <a href=\"http://youtu.be/rlFZ35R3CSw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bob Zmuda</a> calls Mr. X (due to fear of retribution) in his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Andy-Kaufman-Revealed-Friend-Tells/dp/0316681237/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373919466&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Andy+Kaufman+Revealed%21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Andy Kaufman Revealed!</i></a>. Zmuda worked for this apparently psychotic Hollywood screenwriter who would get himself into dangerous or outlandish real-life situations-- like insulting a mob boss' mother at her birthday dinner-- record them on audiotape, and then use those recordings as catalysts for his writing. Such mixing of fact and fiction was catnip for Kaufman, whose life often seemed like a series of pranks and put-ons. So <i>Andy and His Grandmother</i>-- compiled by veteran comedy writer/producer <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0154074/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vernon Chatman</a> (\"Louie\", \"South Park\", \"The Chris Rock Show\") and documentarian <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0038896/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rodney Ascher</a> (the <i>Shining</i>-obsessed <i>Room 237</i>)-- isn't merely a recording of Kaufman's stand-up performances, but rather recordings of real-life conversations that would plant creative seeds in his eccentric mind. Considering that many of the record's most memorable moments document wildly heated phone calls, it can seem like <i>Andy and His Grandmother</i> is more similar to a Jerky Boys album than comedy classics by Steve Martin or Bill Cosby.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Because, by-and-large, this is a record of provocation. It's also probably one of the most clear-eyed accounts of the \"real\" Andy Kaufman in existence, a serious feat considering his notoriously slippery relationship with what most of us call reality. The candidness here can be startling, even by 2013 standards. A track called \"Slice of Life\" has Kaufman talking to one of the many women he bedded while on tour in the late 70s. \"We just screwed and here's the afterward conversation,\" he announces, before continuing: \"It didn't look to me like you were enjoying it that much.\" But this isn't laugh-out-loud funny. It's unflinching. He asks her, \"What happens if you got a baby?\" to which the unnamed woman responds, \"I'll hop a plane to Toronto and get a little abortion.\" Naturally, she asks for him to turn off the tape (there's an entire track here devoted to the voices of people requesting-- often in an incensed tone-- for Kaufman to \"shut that off\") but he's adamant: \"Why is it that nobody understands that the kind of conversations that nobody wants me to tape are the kind of conversations that <i>should</i> be taped?\" It's the sort of philosophy that runs through the work of many great comedians, from Woody Allen to Louis C.K., laid perfectly bare, without the filter of a camera lens, script, or stand-up routine.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Later on, a series of phone calls show up in which Kaufman diabolically riles up a woman who doesn't appreciate her feelings being used as some sort of meta comedy exercise. \"You are fucked up!\" she screams. \"I WANT THOSE FUCKING TAPES!\" The call is followed by Zmuda and Kaufman plotting how they could release the contentious conversations with this one tremendously angry woman as an album. \"The concept would be funny because it's real, but it would be dramatic at the same time,\" Kaufman says, before excitedly suggesting to Zmuda, \"Wouldn't it be great if she killed me and you have the tapes?\" It's uncomfortable comedy, the kind that Kaufman would perfect with Tony Clifton and his inter-gender wrestling career. And these talks with various women accentuate the more problematic sides of his personality, the parts that were addicted to prostitutes and womanizing. \"He <i>hated</i> that he needed to be with women,\" says friend Wendy Polland in <i>Lost in the Funouse</i>, \"because he didn't like the mind games they played with him. Which I guess was sort of ironic, wasn't it?\" <i>Andy and His Grandmother </i>shows him fighting back against these women, and it can sound as compelling as a car crash.</p> <p class=\"p1\">But it's not all unusually cringe-worthy. There are moments when Kaufman's more lighthearted, '77-era persona shows up, like when he takes his grandmother out for a car ride and tries to convince her that a radar is guiding the vehicle (though that track cannily jump-cuts to a confrontation with a traffic cop who threatens to \"knock the shit\" out of a belligerent Kaufman). And all that phone yelling toward the end of the album is foreshadowed by another phone bit, \"Andy Can Talk to Animals\", where Kaufman gets into a shouting match with what sounds like a squealing pig: \"Yeah, whaddya want? Say it fast.\" [pig squeal] \"I had to change my fucking clothes so I can go out and have a good time and you just made me miss my appointment, so <i>fuck you</i>!\" It's funnier than the real arguments-- likely due to the absurdity and lack of actual consequence-- but as Kaufman progressed through the late 70s, coaxing laughs from his audience became less and less of an imperative.</p> <p class=\"p1\">At one point during the album, a wronged woman lashes out at Kaufman in a particularly discombobulated-- but not inaccurate-- manner: \"You think that I really don't know when you goof on me, and you think that I really don't know, and really I know, and you know that I really know, but you say I don't know.\" These are the mental hoops this one-of-a-kind performance artist would force people to go through on a regular basis, whether onstage or in front of his tiny personal recorder. It's why he still resonates and fascinates in our world of meta-this and post-that, why anyone would care about a collection of cobbled together personal recordings from an enigma who's been dead for nearly three decades. Based on <i>Andy and His Grandmother, </i>Kaufman comes off like an asshole, a hopelessly naive loser, a crazy person, a hothead, a hopelessly sweet grandma's boy, a sexually confused teenager, and a manipulative monster. In other words, he comes off like Andy Kaufman.</p>\n"], ["title", "Andy Kaufman: Andy and His Grandmother"], ["updated_at", Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:11:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18256-andy-kaufman-andy-and-his-grandmother/"]]

Denn genau so wichtig wie nach vorn, ist auch die Bewegung nach unten, der kniebeugende Schubberboogie.

Wundervoll, nicht nur wegen der 606 als Taktgeber, den kleinen schwebenden Melodiepartikeln und der omnipräsenten Darkness. Und nun nach vorne. Der Titeltrack legt den Grundton der ganzen Platte fest. Träumerisch hallig, mit schweren Schmatzbass-Steigungen steigt Heinze ein, erst wenn die Kathedrale vollständig mit Sound erfüllt ist, droppt er den Beat. Und plötzlich geht einem das Licht auf: Die einzige Tiefbaufirma, der man je vertrauen sollte, heißt &#8220;Ebbe und Flut&#8221;. Im &#8220;Echo Place&#8221; werden dann Seitenkanal und Restmix vertauscht, die postpostpostpost-Arpeggiator-Kunst übernimmt die Führung, klingt dabei frisch und unverbraucht, steuert aber dennoch wieder direkt in den Zauberwald. &#8220;Leo On LFO&#8221; &#8211; wie geil ist das denn bitte &#8211; kommt fast ganz ohne die Low Frequency Oscillation aus, fokussiert lieber auf den breit gewalzten Acid und &#8211; wir sind wieder in der Kathedrale &#8211; gibt der gewaltigen Orgel einen mindestens genauso kaputt gefilterten Aufritt. Was macht man nun mit einer deratigen Killer-EP, die auf ihrem Weg schon so viele andere Killer gekillt hat?
