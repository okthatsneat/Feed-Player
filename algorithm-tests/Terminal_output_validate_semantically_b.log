Der zweite Affe nimmt die Botschaft auf, bewegt sich federleicht zu Takt und Beats, bis der dritte schließlich in den immer temporeicheren Rhythmen aufgeht.</p>\n<p>Weltall-Musiker Lars Leonhard verbindet in seinen Songs vermeintliche Gegensätze; das Mystische mit dem Leichtem, das Rätselhafte mit dem Lässigen, das Sphärische mit dem Lebendigen. Seine drei Affen könnten auch nur ein einziger sein, der zum Leben erwacht und sich die Welt tanzend zu eigen macht.</p>\n<p>\nVielleicht, wenn auch vom Komponisten unbeabsichtigt, liegt die Erklärung aber in der Philosophie. Im Westen stehen die drei Affen, die nichts hören, nichts sehen und nichts sagen wollen, für alles Schlechte, was wir nicht wahrhaben wollen, sind also negativ besetzt. Der chinesische Philosoph Konfuzius sagt dagegen über die drei Affen: „Was nicht dem Gesetz der Schönheit entspricht, darauf schaue ich nicht; was nicht dem Gesetz der Schönheit entspricht, darauf hören ich nicht; was nicht dem Gesetz der Schönheit entspricht, davon rede ich nicht – was also nicht dem Gesetz der Schönheit entspricht, das tue ich nicht.“ So ist es auch mit den drei Affen von Lars Leonhard: Sie ignorieren das Schlechte – und geben sich allein einer geheimnisvollen Schönheit dieser Musik hin.<br />\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Viel Spaß beim lauschen,</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dreiton.net\" title=\"Dreiton.net\">Dreiton.net</a></p>\n<p/>\n<p>\nWebsite:<br />\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.Lars-Leonhard.de/\">www.Lars-Leonhard.de</a><br />\n<br/></p>\n<p>\nSoundcloud:<br />\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/larsleonhard\">https://soundcloud.com/larsleonhard</a><br />\n<br/></p>\n<p>\nFacebook:<br />\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lars.leonhard\">https://www.facebook.com/lars.leonhard</a><br />\n<br/></p>\n"], ["created_at", Wed, 10 Jul 2013 12:56:31 UTC +00:00], ["feed_id", 1], ["guid", "http://de-bug.de/pod/?p=7920"], ["published_at", Tue, 02 Jul 2013 08:16:42 UTC +00:00], ["summary", "www.dreiton.net Tracklist: 01 &#8211; Lars Leonhard &#8211; Mizaru &#8211; See No Evil &#124; MP3 02 &#8211; Lars Leonhard &#8211; Kikazaru &#8211; Hear No Evil &#124; MP3 03 &#8211; Lars Leonhard &#8211; Iwazaru &#8211; Speak No Evil &#124; MP3 Download Complete Release ZIP 47,9 MB Release: 01/07/2013 Style: Dub Techno / Electronica MP3-Format: 320Kbit/s Stereo DN [...]"], ["title", "DN 028 >>> Lars Leonhard – Three Monkeys"], ["updated_at", Wed, 10 Jul 2013 12:56:31 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://de-bug.de/pod/archives/7920.html"]]
